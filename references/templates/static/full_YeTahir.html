It encompasses the eastern half of New Guinea, the world’s second largest island (the western half is made up of the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua); the Bismarck Archipelago (New Britain, New Ireland, the Admiralty Islands, and several others); Bougainville and Buka (part of the Solomon Islands chain); and small offshore islands and atolls. The national capital, Port Moresby, is located in southeastern New Guinea on the Coral Sea.' <sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> 'Papua New Guinea stretches from just south of the Equator to the Torres Strait, which separates New Guinea from Cape York Peninsula to the south, the northernmost extension of Australia. Mainland Papua New Guinea reaches its maximum north-south expanse of some 510 miles (820 km) along its western border with Indonesian Papua. Almost completely straight, the boundary is formed primarily by the line of longitude 141° E and curves only briefly westward to follow the Fly River for approximately 50 miles (80 km), starting just southwest of Kiunga. From the western border the land tapers-with a substantial indentation in the south coast formed by the Gulf of Papua-to a fingerlike shape that points southeast toward the D’Entrecasteaux Islands and the Louisiade Archipelago. Off the mainland are a number of small islands and island groups scattered to the north and east and, farther northeast, Bougainville Island and the Bismarck Archipelago; the latter forms a crescent that arcs from the Admiralty Islands in the north to New Britain and Umboi Island, off the mainland’s Huon Peninsula.' <sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> 'The Orokaiva reside in the Oro Province of Papua New Guinea and are concentrated in the Popondetta district in an area reaching from the coast at Buna Island to the northern slopes of Mount Lamington and in the regions to the north of this general line. This area is a humid tropical lowland, and uniformly high temperatures and rainfall provide a year-round growing season. The wet season, from December to March, is characterized by northeasterly or northwesterly winds, high temperatures and humidity, and late-afternoon thunderstorms, while the dry season, from May to October, produces northeasterly winds, lower temperatures, less cloud cover, and less-predictable rainfall.' <sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>

</p><p><b> ♠ Peak Date  ♣ 1921-1942 CE ♥ </b> In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the island of New Guinea was controlled by competing colonial powers: 'In response to Australian pressure, the British government annexed Papua in 1888. Gold was discovered shortly thereafter, resulting in a major movement of prospectors and miners to what was then the Northern District. Relations with the Papuans were bad from the start, and there were numerous killings on both sides. The Protectorate of British New Guinea became Australian territory by the passing of the Papua Act of 1905 by the Commonwealth Government of Australia. The new administration adopted a policy of peaceful penetration, and many measures of social and economic national development were introduced. Local control was in the hands of village constables, paid servants of the Crown. Chosen by European officers, they were intermediaries between the government and the people.' <sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> Economic development, resource exploitation, and political consolidation peaked in the decades before World War II: 'Capt. John Moresby of Great Britain surveyed the southeastern coast in the 1870s, and by the 1880s European planters had moved onto New Britain and New Ireland. By 1884 the German New Guinea Company was administering the northeastern quadrant, and a British protectorate was declared over the southeastern quadrant. Despite early gold finds in British New Guinea (which from 1906 was administered by Australia as the colony of Papua), it was in German New Guinea, administered by the German imperial government after 1899, that most early economic activity took place. Plantations were widely established in the New Guinea islands and around Madang, and labourers were transported from the Sepik River region, the Markham valley, and Buka Island. Australian forces displaced the German authorities on New Guinea early in World War I, and the arrangement was formalized in 1921, when Australian control of the northeastern quadrant of the island was mandated by the League of Nations. This territory remained administratively separate from Papua, where the protective paternalist policies of Sir Hubert Murray (lieutenant governor of Papua, 1908-40) did little to encourage colonial investment. The discovery in the 1920s of massive gold deposits in eastern New Guinea at the Bulolo River (a tributary of the Markham River) and Edie Creek, near Wau, led to a rush of activity that greatly increased the economic and social impact on the mandated territory compared with those in Papua to the south. In the early 1930s an even greater discovery was made-contact with nearly one million people previously unknown to Europeans who were living in the Highlands basins of the Australian mandate. During World War II the Japanese army invaded northern New Guinea in early 1942 and took the territorial headquarters in Rabaul. The Japanese were defeated by the Allies (primarily Australian troops) in the Battle of Milne Bay (August-September 1942) in eastern Papua but advanced along the rugged Kokoda Trail almost to the Papuan headquarters at Port Moresby before being pushed back over the mountains, again by Australian troops. The Allied victory in the Battle of the Coral Sea, southwest of the Solomon Islands, saved Port Moresby from a planned Japanese seaborne invasion. U.S. forces then moved quickly north and west across the island chain toward Borneo and beyond. Meanwhile, Australian troops continued a costly war on Bougainville Island and the New Guinea mainland until the Japanese surrender in August 1945.' <sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup>

</p><p><b>♠ Degree of centralization ♣ loose ♥ </b> Orokaiva political organization was fluid and not centralized: 'Political organization incorporates no central authority or hereditary leadership. Instead, it is characterized by big-men(EMBO DAMBO) and an ascendancy of elders who have proved themselves equal to the task. Such men command the respect of the village, based upon observed qualities of generosity, diligence, wealth, ability to make wise decisions, and skill in arranging ceremonial activities. This status confers no sanctioning authority, however. The Orokaiva tribes, around twelve in number, are very loose units politically and recognize no single leader. The largest unit is the tribe, which has a common territory usually demarcated from neighboring tribal territories by a belt of uninhabited land.' <sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> 'The social system is characterized by flexibility in arrangements for group membership and for transmission of rights to land. A village normally contains more than one clan branch and consequently is not necessarily a landholding unit. Residents may have closer kinship ties to residents of other villages than with some of their coresidents. Nevertheless, common residence implies some community of interest and a degree of group solidarity that is reinforced by government policy, which recognizes villages rather than descent groups as functional entities. Marriages between members of different clan branches within the village also reinforce this solidarity, which is expressed in ways such as daily food gifts, cooperation in certain tasks, and joint ceremonial activities. On the average, a lineage comprises three households. Usually, several clans are represented in a village, with members of a single clan (clan branches) being scattered among a number of neighboring villages. Lineages are more localized in cha racter, frequently being confined to a single village and tending to occupy one section of it.' <sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14">[14]</a></sup> During the colonial period, a British and Australian administrative structure was superimposed on the native system: 'In response to Australian pressure, the British government annexed Papua in 1888. Gold was discovered shortly thereafter, resulting in a major movement of prospectors and miners to what was then the Northern District. Relations with the Papuans were bad from the start, and there were numerous killings on both sides.

Local control was in the hands of village constables, paid servants of the Crown. Chosen by European officers, they were intermediaries between the government and the people. In 1951 an eruption occurred on Mount Lamington, completely devastating a large part of the area occupied by the Orokaiva. Survivors were provided with food, medicine, and other relief by the government and were maintained in evacuatio n camps. Large-scale, expertly planned social, economic, and political development began in Papua around 1960 with the introduction of cash crops, agricultural extension work, land-title improvement, road improvement, and educational development.' <sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> The colonial period also saw the emergence of new supralocal religious movements: 'We have already noted the mutual amity which prevails among all branches of the cult, and have discovered cause to suspect that it is based on the fear of sorcery (p. 47). This general amity or fraternity, however, whatever its basis may be, is not only a striking, but on the whole a commendable feature of the cult. Clashes of arms-part in fun, part in earnest-are still common enough among the clans of the north; the warlike display at the welcome of visitors which sometimes leads to these affrays is in fact a regular custom. But although the Taro parties are constantly engaged in travel and visiting, I know of no serious quarrel between rival parties qua Taro parties. It is not necessary to observe that, but for the previous pacification of the Division, the Taro cult could never have spread itself so widely in so short a time. But it is still true that the cult is consolidating the work to which it was in the first place indebted. In fine, by arousing this elementary tendency toward cohesion, by establishing the intertribal power of a few individuals, and by advancing the spirit of intertribal friendliness, the Taro cult has played its part in emphasizing the unity of the Orokaiva. No movement of native origin has, since European occupation, made the same universal appeal to all the clans and tribes of this people.' <sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>

Popondetta, the new administrative centre of the Northern District, has about 4,000 inhabitants, almost all Orokaiva; among its inhabitants all parts of the Northern District are represented, including Sivepe. The Sivepe people had many relatives there, mostly hailing from the Sasembata district, and employed in some regular job in the town. These jobs are partly in personal service to Europeans, but also in light industry, the retail trade, public works and public service, and go far beyond the little employment that was available in preeruption Higaturu (with a population which, judging from aerial photographs, can hardly have exceeded that of a large village). Popondetta is preeminently the place where intelligent men from various villages can gather informally to discuss political and other public questions, and develop a wider interpretation of the situation of the Orokaiva which is learnt by the men from the villages when they pay occasional visits to Popondetta. The town generates a new sophistication which is spreading to the villages.

This line, together with the territorial boundary which coincides with the 8th meridian, would enclose the demesne of the people whom we call Orokaiva. One cannot do better than follow the distribution given by E. W. P. Chinnery and the late W. N.

Similarly in the south the specified boundary beginning at Oro Bay cannot be regarded as a rigid limit, for along the coast of Dyke Ackland Bay almost as far as Cape Nelson, there are settled several groups of people who are virtually identical with the Orokaiva although commonly named Okeina. The present report, however, will observe the limits already set down.' <sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-49">[49]</a></sup> The Northern Division is around 22,800 km squared. This kind of regional integration was a result of colonial policies.
</p><p><b> ♠ Polity Population ♣ 9,000 ♥ </b> People. The number of Orokaiva at the time of first contact is unknown due to lack of demographic data: 'The indigenous population of the Popondetta district totals some 36,500, of whom 26,500 are Orokaiva in the central lowland area. The number of Orokaiva at the time of Western contact is not known. [Editors note: Ethnologue (SIL International), lists 33,400 as of 1989.]' <sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-50">[50]</a></sup> Williams claims around 9,000 residents for the early 20th century. [Ira Baschkow (pers. comm.): This is a realistic figure. If conflicting figures exist, these will be found in the Papua Annual Reports. Janice Newton (pers. comm.): Caveat: early colonists often underestimate the size of indigenous populations. Jonathan Ritchie (pers. comm.): Patrol reports could serve as a primary source to investigate this.] 'It is on the assumption of general uniformity among the tribes that the present report claims to refer to the people as a whole. The tribe with which I am best acquainted is that of the Aiga, who seemed to offer the best opportunities for research because they are fairly central and as yet less contaminated by European influence than most of the others. Out of a total Orokaiva population of some 9,000, this tribe numbers approximately 1,300, who are scattered in nearly fifty villages on or between the Opi and Kumusi rivers. To avoid confusion it will be the rule of this report to use the Aiga dialectal form for native words.' <sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-51">[51]</a></sup> 'Koropata is part of the Orokaivan linguistic division which according to Williams (1930:7) numbered about 9000 in the 1920s. The Orokaivans live mainly in the Saiho Census Division which is the most densely populated part of the Northern Province. In the 1980 census the population of this division was 8715 (National [Page 62] Statistics Office 1980:14). The Saiho Census area covers the rich volcanic plains around Mt Lamington, criss-crossed by numerous streams and rivers, notably the Kumusi River. The thick dark brown topsoil combined with a thin layer of volcanic ash produces extremely fertile soil. The warm humid climate and very high rainfall (2000-3500mm per annum) mean that the land is excellent for subsistence gardening and offers some of the best prospects for agricultural development in Northern Province (CSIRO 1954:4, 10-12).' <sup id="cite_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-52">[52]</a></sup> The regional integration that allows us to treat the Orokaiva as a population rather than an assortment of individual tribes and villages was a result of colonial policies.
</p><p><b> ♠ Population of the largest settlement ♣ [600-800] ♥ </b> Inhabitants. The Orokaiva settled in small villages rather than urban centres. The colonial authorities also established settlements, especially in coastal areas. Ira Baschkow<sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-53">[53]</a></sup>: 'Through WWII these were only small settlements, hardly worthy of the term "town" at all.' Janice Newton<sup id="cite_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-54">[54]</a></sup>: 'A few families of Orokaivans had visited Port Moresby and worked there or been imprisoned there before the second World War. By the 1970s Port Moresby had built up quite a large population in squatter settlements but these were informally ordered into regional sections and sometimes involved rent payments to original landowners. Popondetta was a small agricultural base before the war, became strategic during the war as an allied air base and was developed as a small administration centre with a few general stores after the war. Although there were small 'squatter like’ settlements around the outskirts in 1977-9 it was nothing like Port Moresby in terms of makeshift developments.' Jonathan Ritchie<sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-55">[55]</a></sup>: Does he mean Port Moresby?  The other ‘urban’ locations were hardly that, at least in Northern District/Province) - and wasn’t Higaturu the main centre - not a town at all but the administrative headquarters?  Nigel Oram (Colonial Town to Melanesian City) and Ian Stuart (Port Moresby Yesterday and Today 1970.)have written about early Port Moresby (and should have population estimates).] 'The small urban population lives for the most part in towns whose original location was determined either by access to a good harbour for early colonial planters or, in the interior, by the availability of level land sufficient for an airstrip. Despite the greatly diminished importance of plantations and the relocation of most of these airstrips out of the towns, those origins helped determine the existing urban layout. Port Moresby and Lae, on the Huon Gulf, are the largest cities.' <sup id="cite_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-56">[56]</a></sup> 'The establishment of towns, unknown before the coming of Europeans, has forced an even more drastic adaptation than have the changes in rural areas. For a man to leave his village and go to work in the town means long separation from his family and from his kin, an experience unheard of in the past. Separation from his relatives means that he may be facing dangerous risks from the sorcery of foreigners in an unknown country. This is one reason why migrant workers tend to live in kin clusters in the towns. Unemployment, inadequate living quarters, low wages, the necessity for paying in cash for all goods and services, and the obligation to send cash gifts to relatives in the villages, all add to the town dwellers' difficulties.' <sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-57">[57]</a></sup> Popondetta is a notable example in the Northern Division: 'Popondetta is a small town, population 6343 in 1980 (National Statistics Office 1980:14), with a few general stores, a market, hospital, courthouse, various government and semi-government offices and an hotel. It is a sleepy town, livened only recently by oil palm activity, the bustle of wholesale buying for village trade stores, and the ‘fortnight’, the government pay day, which stimulates a long weekend of drinking, singing and the occasional fight. Children love to visit the ‘town’, but adult women in particular yearn for the bright lights of Port Moresby spoken of by their menfolk.' <sup id="cite_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-58">[58]</a></sup> Its size in colonial times is unclear from the sources, but as indicated by the expert, the colonial 'towns' did not amount to much at the time. We have therefore decided to code for Orokaiva villages instead; we have provided a range based on a number provided below (see 'settlement hierarchy').

<p>Residential villages are predominant: 'Small villages with populations not exceeding 720 are the typical units of settlement, with houses dispersed in a more or less rectangular form around a central earth or grass "square." Villages are in flat clearings where the grass is scrupulously cut and kept free of rubbish. Houses are built by the men, each house normally being occupied by one nuclear family.

Traditionally the villager operated within quite narrowly circumscribed physical limits. Each community functioned largely as an independent subsistence unit, almost all the requirements of life being produced through shifting agriculture and the subsidiary pursuits of fishing, hunting and foraging on its own land. Production was directed almost entirely to immediate and direct consumption, none of the staple foodstuffs except yams lending themselves to storage; exchange was confined largely to kindred within the community or in closely neighbouring communities. Beyond this, minor and informal trade links had developed between some of the inland and coastal peoples, but the degree of inter-dependence established can be considered insignificant.' <sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-64">[64]</a></sup> The rural settlement pattern may have become more dispersed during the colonial period: 'Williams and others judge that with the modern pacification, the Orokaiva have tended to disperse in even smaller living units than before. This appears to apply particularly to the relatively densely populated Lamington slopes, though a few instances of larger aggregations approaching a village type also occurred, particularly as a result of Mission influence. Over against this greater dispersal, the people have mingled more freely as a result of travel on the government roads and trails (which they have to keep in order), trading, Mission and official gatherings, and other new opportunities for interpersonal relations. One special feature of Orokaiva life in modern times is the annual burning-off of grasslands by hunting parties in order to get wild game. This has probably involved the assembly of larger groups and is one of the few activities which could induce intersettlement co-operation. The writer sensed the parallel of the crude local fires set for garden clearing and the general burning-off of grasslands to the major burning and blackening in the wake of the volcano-doubtless a mighty job of clearing to the Orokaiva eye.' <sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-65">[65]</a></sup> The colonial authorities also established settlements. [Ira Baschkow (pers. comm.): Through WWII these were only small settlements, hardly worthy of the term "town" at all. Janice Newton (pers. comm.): A few families of Orokaivans had visited Port Moresby and worked there or been imprisoned there before the second World War, . By the 1970s Port Moresby had built up quite a large population in squatter settlements but these were informally ordered into regional sections and sometimes involved rent payments to original landowners. Popondetta was a small agricultural base before the war, became strategic during the war as an allied air base and was developed as a small administration centre with a few general stores after the war. Although there were small 'squatter like’ settlements around the outskirts in 1977-9 it was nothing like Port Moresby in terms of makeshift developments. Jonathan Ritchie (pers. comm.): Does he mean Port Moresby?  The other ‘urban’ locations were hardly that, at least in Northern District/Province) - and wasn’t Higaturu the main centre - not a town at all but the administrative headquarters?  Nigel Oram (Colonial Town to Melanesian City) and Ian Stuart (Port Moresby Yesterday and Today 1970.)have written about early Port Moresby (and should have population estimates).] 'The establishment of towns, unknown before the coming of Europeans, has forced an even more drastic adaptation than have the changes in rural areas. For a man to leave his village and go to work in the town means long separation from his family and from his kin, an experience unheard of in the past. Separation from his relatives means that he may be facing dangerous risks from the sorcery of foreigners in an unknown country. This is one reason why migrant workers tend to live in kin clusters in the towns. Unemployment, inadequate living quarters, low wages, the necessity for paying in cash for all goods and services, and the obligation to send cash gifts to relatives in the villages, all add to the town dwellers' difficulties.' <sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-66">[66]</a></sup> 'The small urban population lives for the most part in towns whose original location was determined either by access to a good harbour for early colonial planters or, in the interior, by the availability of level land sufficient for an airstrip. Despite the greatly diminished importance of plantations and the relocation of most of these airstrips out of the towns, those origins helped determine the existing urban layout. Port Moresby and Lae, on the Huon Gulf, are the largest cities.' <sup id="cite_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-67">[67]</a></sup> Popondetta is a notable example: 'Popondetta is a small town, population 6343 in 1980 (National Statistics Office 1980:14), with a few general stores, a market, hospital, courthouse, various government and semi-government offices and an hotel. It is a sleepy town, livened only recently by oil palm activity, the bustle of wholesale buying for village trade stores, and the ‘fortnight’, the government pay day, which stimulates a long weekend of drinking, singing and the occasional fight. Children love to visit the ‘town’, but adult women in particular yearn for the bright lights of Port Moresby spoken of by their menfolk.' <sup id="cite_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-68">[68]</a></sup> We have provisionally assumed that most Orokaiva continued to reside in rural villages rather than small colonial settlements.

<p>Initially, political authority was confined to the informal leadership of elders and local big men: 'Political organization incorporates no central authority or hereditary leadership. Instead, it is characterized by big-men(EMBO DAMBO) and an ascendancy of elders who have proved themselves equal to the task. Such men command the respect of the village, based upon observed qualities of generosity, diligence, wealth, ability to make wise decisions, and skill in arranging ceremonial activities. This status confers no sanctioning authority, however. The Orokaiva tribes, around twelve in number, are very loose units politically and recognize no single leader. The largest unit is the tribe, which has a common territory usually demarcated from neighboring tribal territories by a belt of uninhabited land.' <sup id="cite_ref-69" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-69">[69]</a></sup> The labour and support of wives and younger men was key in the career of big men: 'Without multiple wives or a pool of single men retainers, the scope for a leader in large-scale exchange is limited. The lack of retainers attaching themselves to leaders' households could perhaps be due to the end of warfare and to improved community health so that there are now few orphans or fatherless sons. Almost every youth has a father or older brother to guarantee the payment of his brideprice. The productive relations between old men and young men are interesting in that they provide the possibility for a form of exploitation or unequal return for equal work, with the old men withholding the young men's access to a bride.' <sup id="cite_ref-70" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-70">[70]</a></sup> 'The social system is characterized by flexibility in arrangements for group membership and for transmission of rights to land. A village normally contains more than one clan branch and consequently is not necessarily a landholding unit. Residents may have closer kinship ties to residents of other villages than with some of their coresidents. Nevertheless, common residence implies some community of interest and a degree of group solidarity that is reinforced by government policy, which recognizes villages rather than descent groups as functional entities. Marriages between members of different clan branches within the village also reinforce this solidarity, which is expressed in ways such as daily food gifts, cooperation in certain tasks, and joint ceremonial activities. On the average, a lineage comprises three households. Usually, several clans are represented in a village, with members of a single clan (clan branches) being scattered among a number of neighboring villages. Lineages are more localized in cha racter, frequently being confined to a single village and tending to occupy one section of it.' <sup id="cite_ref-71" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-71">[71]</a></sup> 'There were ordinarily no persons who could command the allegiance of the tribe as a whole, nor was there any status with authority to effect the settlement of disputes between different subgroups or their individual members. Sometimes persistent intratribal conflicts led to short-term migration or to a splinter-group's secession from the tribe. However, these disturbances were very minor in comparison with the ‘flight, dispersal and migration’ in general resulting from incessant intertribal  feuds (see p. 35).' <sup id="cite_ref-72" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-72">[72]</a></sup> According to Williams, village and clan clusters occasionally formed ad hoc alliances when facing external threats: 'Williams ascribes the formation of ‘somewhat loose’ and temporary ‘confederacies of clans’, which conducted raids upon the tribe's kitoho, to a local spirit. But it is not clear whether by this he means the identification of members of a tribe with one territory or the unity of the ‘locality group’ which usually takes in a number of ‘clan-village units’ (see p.34) and which he describes as a more restricted ‘sympathy-group’ than the tribe (1930:107, 157, 163, 309-12). When he states (1925:407) that ‘over and above clan patriarchs there are recognised leaders of small clan confederacies and even - in war-time - of tribes’, he seems to equate the tribe with the district among the mountain Orokaiva (in particular Wasida and Isivita; see W.23, 124).' <sup id="cite_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-73">[73]</a></sup> 'This combination for better defence may have been characteristic of tribes throughout the Orokaiva area. We believe, however, that the subdividing of the tribe into discrete named groups of named villages (either district or ‘hamlet group’) would be unique to the mountain Orokaiva in the culture area; we do not have enough evidence to show if this feature is related to the earlier clustering for safety, and to the greater population density in this tribe.' <sup id="cite_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-74">[74]</a></sup> During the colonial period, British and Australian authorities superimposed their own administrative structure on the native system, installing village constables as intermediaries: 'In response to Australian pressure, the British government annexed Papua in 1888. Gold was discovered shortly thereafter, resulting in a major movement of prospectors and miners to what was then the Northern District. Relations with the Papuans were bad from the start, and there were numerous killings on both sides. The Protectorate of British New Guinea became Australian territory by the passing of the Papua Act of 1905 by the Commonwealth Government of Australia. The new administration adopted a policy of peaceful penetration, and many measures of social and economic national development were introduced. Local control was in the hands of village constables, paid servants of the Crown. Chosen by European officers, they were intermediaries between the government and the people. In 1951 an eruption occurred on Mount Lamington, completely devastating a large part of the area occupied by the Orokaiva.' <sup id="cite_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-75">[75]</a></sup> [Janice Newton (pers. comm.): After official British annexation in 1884 and Crown colony status in 1888, in 1890 a police force was formed and a Resident Magistrate appointed for each administrative division.  It seems there was not much training. The early constabulary were taught a little English and some of the rules for living like the white man (latrines, cleanliness etc). The British administration appointed village officials, village constables and armed constabulary. Often the Orokaivans were captured, taken back to stations taught some English and some of the English ways and laws. Imprisonment of villagers for offences was another way of imparting British principles of law.  By 1924 many adult males had passed through the Armed Constabulary and hardly an adult male had not worked for Europeans  (Cyndi Banks Women in Transition: Social Control in PNG Australian Institute of Criminology 1993).]

<p>Ritual practices were initially confined to the household level:'The belief in ghosts and spirits is a predominant characteristic of the northern native. In almost every tribe I have observed the propitiation of family ghosts with individual offerings of food by ordinary persons to secure the vitality of their food supply, and by sorcerers to stimulate their charms. Ghosts are invoked during ceremonies by divination to reveal crimes and criminals. Food offerings to ghosts are made during death feasts and during certain initiation rites. The house of initiation and the paraphernalia of the dance are believed to have spiritual powers, and when the paraphernalia are thrown into the river at the completion of the rites, they are invoked to smite the enemies of the dancers.' <sup id="cite_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-76">[76]</a></sup> 'The traditional beliefs of the Orokaiva, though in many respects vague and locally variable, focused primarily on the "spirits of the dead" and their influence on the living. The Orokaiva had no high god. Formerly, they were animists, believing in the existence of souls (ASISI) in humans, plants, and animals. The taro spirit was of particular importance and was the inspiration and foundation of the Taro Cult. The Orokaiva have been swept recently by a series of new cults, indicative of their religious adaptability in the face of fresh experience. Mission influence is strong in the Northern District. Religious training is provided almost exclusively by the Anglican church, although mission influence has not totally eradicated traditional beliefs, producing an air of mysticism about the resultant religious system.' <sup id="cite_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-77">[77]</a></sup> The colonial period saw both the spread of Christianity and the emergence of new supralocal religious movements: 'Mission influence is strong in the Northern District. This is provided almost exclusively by the Anglican church and is of a fairly orthodox nature. Mission influence is mixed somewhat with traditional beliefs and there is an air of mysticism about the resultant religious system.' <sup id="cite_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-78">[78]</a></sup> 'There has been European contact of some form over a long period. The people are perhaps best known by the work of Williams (1928 and 1930) in which he describes the earlier cult movements and the attempts to master and control new contact situations. Two of these were the cult of the Baigona men and the Taro cult. The former was concerned with healing and sorcery through a type of priest who was in communication with the spirits of the dead and now resident in various reptiles, particularly the snake. The latter was evidenced in sorcery through a priest who was possessed with the spirit of the Taro. Violent dancing or ecstatic movements often accompanied by a trance were not unlike the dance of St Vitus or St John which swept Europe in the fourteenth century (Sargant 1957).' <sup id="cite_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-79">[79]</a></sup> The Taro and Snake Cults are notable examples: 'The Orokaiva religious history is also particularly interesting here. Their traditional faith, Williams says, though in many respects vague and locally variable, concerned itself “primarily with the spirits of the dead” and their influence  on the welfare of the living. Death was appraised with particular realism, although it was considered ultimately as the result of supernatural causes. Magic had a consistent place. Orokaiva country, however, has been swept in modern times by a series of new cults indicative of religious adaptability in the face of fresh experience. First to come into prominence was the Baigona, or “snake cult” of 1911-12, succeeded from 1914 on by the so-called “Taro cult” which in turn had undergone a series of local reformulations by the time Williams reported on it in 1924.  Central features of the Taro cult were association of successful taro cultivation with the ancestral spirits, approached by way of a “shaking-fit” technique of revelation, together with somewhat new types of public ritual and symbols, including fragmentary elements from Christianity. Later Belshaw and others reported that “Christian Co-operative Evangelist” societies, which were developed by the Anglican Mission among some Orokaiva converts for the cooperative growing of rice and other crops, tended to assume a somewhat parallel and absorbing mystical agriculture context. Rumors spread of “an order from the King (of England) that co-operatives should be formed … (and that) as a result of their activities the white people would leave Papua and the villagers would be in charge of their own affairs.” This type of cooperative movement was stimulated after the war, and included putting crosses in the gardens, offering prayers before gardening activity, building special houses in which cooperators could meet and eat, and collecting money for vague purposes. Even in the face of Mission reluctance and some Orokaiva opposition, Government finally stepped in to try to give it better direction; a Cooperative officer was trying to bring the situation under control when the volcano exploded.' <sup id="cite_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-80">[80]</a></sup> The specialists serving the Taro Cult are known as Taro men: 'Orokaiva shamans, or "taro men" serve as healers, weather magicians, and sorcerers.' <sup id="cite_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-81">[81]</a></sup> The movement has produced leaders of intertribal renown: 'While practically every one has been a willing convert to the Taro cult in so far as it meant participation in the song and feast, and while perhaps the majority have given way at some time or other to the pleasant abandonment of the jipari, there is a wide class of Taro experts or special exponents of the cult. It is impossible to set a definite limit to this class. There are some who are recognized as leaders and who are very strongly ‘possessed’, and others who are little more than laymen. However, it is possible to include them all under the name of ba-embo, which means literally ‘Taro man’. Such men, who, like the Baigona men, might be called priests of the cult, officiate and lead in the ceremonial feasting; they perform certain duties in the taro gardens; they make a special practice of jipari and similar contortions; and they subject themselves to certain taboos. The theory of their conduct is that of possession by a spirit, either of the taro itself or of the dead.' <sup id="cite_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-82">[82]</a></sup> 'It is perhaps on law and organization that the Taro cult has the most significant effect, albeit a rudimentary and indefinite one. The voluntary acceptance of a new ritual, however lax, the observance of taboos, the necessity for probation, are all influences making for law and law-abidingness. More significant still is the elementary hierarchy which we have observed among the Taro men (p. 32). The existence of leaders in one tribe who are recognized by distant votaries of the cult in another tribe stands perhaps for a new idea among the Orokaiva. The absence of any political cohesion among and within the peoples of Papua has been remarked by others. It is conceivable that such a movement as Taro might give the initial impetus to some more or less spontaneous political organization.' <sup id="cite_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-83">[83]</a></sup> The codes given above combine local practice with patterns of the Taro Cult, reflecting its importance within the framework of culture change.

<p>The Orokaiva did not employ professional military officers in interclan warfare, relying on residential and kin ties as well as informal leadership: 'In interclan warfare, the Binandere organised a division of fighting labour. The first group, the scouts, were sent ahead to kill the scouts of the enemy's main body. Then there were the front-line fighters, experienced men armed with clubs/spears and shields, forming the vanguard. Then there was a group of young people and men who had not killed. They beat drums, blew conch shells, sang war songs and generally used sound to frighten the enemy. Full-scale tribal warfare required the addition of two more groups. Firstly, sorcerers were carried on roofed litters from which they attempted to ward off enemy spirits. Being ritually pure they could have no contact with water. They ate only baked taro or bananas with coconut juice as well as much ginger. The second additional group were the strategists who were vital for long-drawn-out battles. This small group planned tactics, directed the front line and organised ambush killings and so on (1972:13-25).' <sup id="cite_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-84">[84]</a></sup> 'Kinship and local affiliation together were the basic principles by which subgroups of the raiding party seem to have been drawn up during attack and on which leaders  within the party based their rights to command specific combatants.' <sup id="cite_ref-85" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-85">[85]</a></sup> 'Waiko (1972) describes in detail the warfare of the Binandere, a society which like the ancient Spartans was reputed to practise infanticide on weak or deformed sons (Monckton 1922:130). Training for warfare began at an early age for boys. At about 12 years old they began living together in a men's house and learning to dodge spears and to hold shields. Eventually they were required to prove themselves by killing a person in a raid (Waiko 1972:21). Part of the education imparted to the youths in the house was their primary duty to take revenge for the death of a clan member. A clan victim represented the clan and failure to avenge his death badly weakened their prestige and status. Killings had up to two generations delayed payback (1972:24-5).' <sup id="cite_ref-86" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-86">[86]</a></sup> There was no supralocal tribal leadership: 'There were ordinarily no persons who could command the allegiance of the tribe as a whole, nor was there any status with authority to effect the settlement of disputes between different subgroups or their individual members. Sometimes persistent intratribal conflicts led to short-term migration or to a splinter-group's secession from the tribe.

But it is not clear whether by this he means the identification of members of a tribe with one territory or the unity of the ‘locality group’ which usually takes in a number of ‘clan-village units’ (see p.34) and which he describes as a more restricted ‘sympathy-group’ than the tribe (1930:107, 157, 163, 309-12). When he states (1925:407) that ‘over and above clan patriarchs there are recognised leaders of small clan confederacies and even - in war-time - of tribes’, he seems to equate the tribe with the district among the mountain Orokaiva (in particular Wasida and Isivita; see W.23, 124).' <sup id="cite_ref-88" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-88">[88]</a></sup> During the colonial period, a constabulary was formed: 'Thus, in the initial contact period, there were two major influences on the Orokaivan social order. First, the narrow moral universe of pre-contact days was widened. Orokaivans united in attempts to repulse the European intruders and also began to modify their traditional magic to improve taro. New spiritual rationale and ritual for these taro cults quickly spread through the Division after pacification.  Some Orokaivans united with Europeans as armed constabulary or as friends and defenders of the missionaries.' <sup id="cite_ref-89" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-89">[89]</a></sup> [Janice Newton (pers. comm.): After official British annexation in 1884 and Crown colony status in 1888, in 1890 a police force was formed and a Resident Magistrate appointed for each administrative division.

By 1924 many adult males had passed through the Armed Constabulary and hardly an adult male had not worked for Europeans  (Cyndi Banks Women in Transition: Social Control in PNG Australian Institute of Criminology 1993).] In this case, a clear-cut distinction between law enforcement and military is hard to establish. In World War II, Orokaiva men were drafted into the Australian colonial army: 'The war of 1939-1945 affected the Yega in several important ways. Their territory became one of the major battlefields of the Pacific War. Every person migrated from the area with the exception of one old crippled woman who somehow managed to survive for eighteen months in the bush. Almost all able-bodied men served in the army or labour corps and the women and children lived at another Anglican mission about thirty miles to the north. When they returned, they found all buildings, and any belongings that they had left behind, destroyed and most of their coconut palms cut down or damaged by gunfire. There were some compensations. The Australian Government paid thousands of dollars in war-damage compensation for all trees and property but, more important, the stimulus of travel, and meeting and working with Australian and American soldiers, gave the younger men in particular a broader view of life which triggered off changes in their traditional economy. In addition, the transfer of the Administrative headquarters from Buna to Higaturu resulted in the construction of a major road to the port of Cape Killerton and brought the Yega into closer touch with the outside world than ever before. As a result, between 1945 and 1950, about twenty families left their re-built villages and moved east to found the new village of Surilai at Cape Killerton (Fig. 9).' <sup id="cite_ref-90" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-90">[90]</a></sup> Orokaiva men also worked as carriers, although their loyalties as a group were at times ambiguous: 'Those in the Northern Division saw the Japanese invasion, bloody fighting and occupation by Allied forces. This led to the peculiar position where the Orokaivans were seen as ‘fuzzy wuzzy angels’ as well as traitors and murderers. ‘Fuzzy wuzzy angel’  was a nickname given to conscripted carriers who demonstrated remarkable solicitude for the wounded whom they carried during the battle on the Kokoda Trail, and who showed considerable endurance in carrying both men and supplies for the Allies over the four months from July until October 1942. The Japanese presence in Northern Division did, however, lead to a reassessment of loyalties on the part of the Orokaivans and the consequent betrayal of some Allied personnel.' <sup id="cite_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-91">[91]</a></sup> Orokaivas were conscripted into many non-combat roles as well: 'During the heavy fighting, most villagers had fled to garden houses where they could hide safely. However, in June 1942, there was an order made that ‘any native might be conscripted to serve anywhere in the Territories or Papua or New Guinea, more or less on any conditions imposed by the District Officers’.  Carriers had worked so well during the Kokoda campaign that officials of the Australian New Guinea Army Unit (ANGAU) were keen to recruit more (Army File 285/1/680A; Benson 1957:18; Ryan 1969). Those men who were able to avoid the physical confrontations of the war by hiding in rough garden shelters for the duration could not avoid the consequences of the war. They became subject to conscription for work on plantations, for carrying, for malaria control and for clearing and construction work until the war was over (Army File 5/3/147).' <sup id="cite_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-92">[92]</a></sup> The code reflects intertribal warfare rather than the Constabulary and colonial armed forces or the World War situation (and may therefore be somewhat dated). Both were realities of the colonial period. Some information on the Constabulary was included under 'Professions'. [Jonathan Ritchie (pers. comm.): On the military, I think pre-War this means the Police… and during the War, we’re looking at the Papuan Infantry Battalion - perhaps either Jim Sinclair’s To Find a Path - The Life and Times of the Royal Pacific Islands Regiment or G.M. Byrnes’ Green Shadows will help?  The first recruits for the PIB were 70 from the Buna area - who I think were all drawn from the Royal Papuan Constabulary - who came in July 1940, supplemented by another 62 in May 1941. 'Military training was carried out until August 28, 1940 when everybody was put on road construction. During November, 24-hour guard duty was ordered at key points in the Port area [of Port Moresby]…. Until the end of August 1941 the guarding of vulnerable points, together with working parties on roads and wharves and training were the duties of the battalion. During September the battalion was allotted the defence area from Napa Napa to Jolers Bay. Recce (Reconnaissance) parties covered this area and the two companies moved out to positions in the allotted areas and began constructing tactical roads and defence positions. Working parties were practically discontinued as guard duties and intensive training were the order of the day.’ (from Byrnes, pp. 5-6).]

<p><b> ♠ Occupational complexity ♣ absent ♥ </b> Rural economies were dominated by subsistence farming: 'The household is the basic unit of production and consumption, with swidden horticulture as the subsistence base. The main crop is taro, which occupies about 90 percent of the cultivated land. A variety of other plants are grown as well, including bananas, sugarcane, edible PITPIT, and a few introduced cultigens such as pineapples, tomatoes, beans, and sweet potatoes. Although the Orokaiva traditionally tended coconut, sago, betel-nut, and a few other varieties of trees in gardens, villages, and in the bush, their arboriculture was rudimentary in comparison to their precise and detailed attention to tubers, especially taro. A good deal of plant and animal food is obtained by foraging, especially in the tropical rain forest that covers most of the Northern District. Foraged animal foods include grubs, frogs, snails, rats, and bush eggs. Foraged plant foods are valued during the dry season, when roots, leaves, and fern fronds make up part of a meal. Fish are an important resource, being used not only for consum ption but for trade. Hunting is less important; the usual quarry consists of small marsupials, birds, and pigs. Pigs, dogs, and fowl have been domesticated and each man has one or more small dogs that he uses for hunting but that are ultimately destined for the pot. Fowl are a useful source of meat, eggs, and feathers for decoration on headdresses, spears, etc. Domestic pigs are slowly disappearing from the villages, due to a government campaign to eliminate pig husbandry in an attempt to improve village hygiene.' <sup id="cite_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-93">[93]</a></sup> 'Cooperation among men is common during hunting and house-building. Cooperation of a total village is rare, but there are cooperative hunting and fishing expeditions. There is also a sharp sexual division of labor. Men hunt; prepare tools and equipment; make sago; plant all crops, both traditional (taro, yams, sweet potatoes) and introduced (rubber, coffee); maintain the yams and rubber; harvest rubber; and market coffee. Women cook, care for the sick, maintain the taro and sweet potatoes, harvest taro, and market root crops. Men and women both fish, build fences, collect firewood, maintain and harvest the coffee crop, and market rubber.' <sup id="cite_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-94">[94]</a></sup> 'In response to Australian pressure during the colonial period, rubber, coffee, and coconut palms for copra have been planted, providing the Orokaiva with a reliable and substantial cash income in recent years.' <sup id="cite_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-95">[95]</a></sup> Unskilled wage labour and cash cropping were introduced during the colonial period: 'As a result of early colonial force it was men who were to be that part of the social group compelled to wage labour or to grow cash crops. This fitted well with traditional organization in which men were absent through the political demands of warfare and feasting. However, it did extend the situation so that women were called upon to do more of those daily work tasks which had been seen as the role of men. Even if the reinforcing ideology of sexual complementarity had broken down, the new outside powers did nothing legally to temper the ultimate physical superiority of the males: there was no official repression of wife beating or construction of an alternative model of marriage in law. Hence there was nothing in the law of the new power to inhibit a man's reliance on his wife or sister for much of his subsistence. While men control household money there exists the potential for greater inequality between men and women. As money can be hidden in banks it has the potential to be stored and to accumulate for a longer period than traditional items and, more importantly, can then be exchanged for almost any other item, transactions made for profit being possible within the capitalist system. As the Melpa men say (Strathern 1979:544), ‘Money is too “strong a thing” to be left to women to manage’.' <sup id="cite_ref-96" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-96">[96]</a></sup> The same is true for towns: 'The establishment of towns, unknown before the coming of Europeans, has forced an even more drastic adaptation than have the changes in rural areas. For a man to leave his village and go to work in the town means long separation from his family and from his kin, an experience unheard of in the past. Separation from his relatives means that he may be facing dangerous risks from the sorcery of foreigners in an unknown country. This is one reason why migrant workers tend to live in kin clusters in the towns. Unemployment, inadequate living quarters, low wages, the necessity for paying in cash for all goods and services, and the obligation to send cash gifts to relatives in the villages, all add to the town dwellers' difficulties.' <sup id="cite_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-97">[97]</a></sup> 'The small urban population lives for the most part in towns whose original location was determined either by access to a good harbour for early colonial planters or, in the interior, by the availability of level land sufficient for an airstrip. Despite the greatly diminished importance of plantations and the relocation of most of these airstrips out of the towns, those origins helped determine the existing urban layout. Port Moresby and Lae, on the Huon Gulf, are the largest cities.' <sup id="cite_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-98">[98]</a></sup> But most of the Orokaiva populaton remained rural during the colonial period.

The first group, the scouts, were sent ahead to kill the scouts of the enemy's main body. Then there were the front-line fighters, experienced men armed with clubs/spears and shields, forming the vanguard. Then there was a group of young people and men who had not killed. They beat drums, blew conch shells, sang war songs and generally used sound to frighten the enemy. Full-scale tribal warfare required the addition of two more groups. Firstly, sorcerers were carried on roofed litters from which they attempted to ward off enemy spirits. Being ritually pure they could have no contact with water. They ate only baked taro or bananas with coconut juice as well as much ginger. The second additional group were the strategists who were vital for long-drawn-out battles.

Eventually they were required to prove themselves by killing a person in a raid (Waiko 1972:21). Part of the education imparted to the youths in the house was their primary duty to take revenge for the death of a clan member.

</p><p><b> ♠ Professional priesthood ♣ absent ♥ </b> Ritual practices were initially confined to the household level:'The belief in ghosts and spirits is a predominant characteristic of the northern native. In almost every tribe I have observed the propitiation of family ghosts with individual offerings of food by ordinary persons to secure the vitality of their food supply, and by sorcerers to stimulate their charms. Ghosts are invoked during ceremonies by divination to reveal crimes and criminals. Food offerings to ghosts are made during death feasts and during certain initiation rites. The house of initiation and the paraphernalia of the dance are believed to have spiritual powers, and when the paraphernalia are thrown into the river at the completion of the rites, they are invoked to smite the enemies of the dancers.' <sup id="cite_ref-125" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-125">[125]</a></sup> 'The traditional beliefs of the Orokaiva, though in many respects vague and locally variable, focused primarily on the "spirits of the dead" and their influence on the living. The Orokaiva had no high god. Formerly, they were animists, believing in the existence of souls (ASISI) in humans, plants, and animals. The taro spirit was of particular importance and was the inspiration and foundation of the Taro Cult. The Orokaiva have been swept recently by a series of new cults, indicative of their religious adaptability in the face of fresh experience. Mission influence is strong in the Northern District. Religious training is provided almost exclusively by the Anglican church, although mission influence has not totally eradicated traditional beliefs, producing an air of mysticism about the resultant religious system.' <sup id="cite_ref-126" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-126">[126]</a></sup> The colonial period saw both the spread of Christianity and the emergence of new religious movements: 'Mission influence is strong in the Northern District. This is provided almost exclusively by the Anglican church and is of a fairly orthodox nature. Mission influence is mixed somewhat with traditional beliefs and there is an air of mysticism about the resultant religious system.' <sup id="cite_ref-127" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-127">[127]</a></sup> 'There has been European contact of some form over a long period. The people are perhaps best known by the work of Williams (1928 and 1930) in which he describes the earlier cult movements and the attempts to master and control new contact situations. Two of these were the cult of the Baigona men and the Taro cult. The former was concerned with healing and sorcery through a type of priest who was in communication with the spirits of the dead and now resident in various reptiles, particularly the snake. The latter was evidenced in sorcery through a priest who was possessed with the spirit of the Taro. Violent dancing or ecstatic movements often accompanied by a trance were not unlike the dance of St Vitus or St John which swept Europe in the fourteenth century (Sargant 1957).' <sup id="cite_ref-128" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-128">[128]</a></sup> The Taro and Snake Cults are notable examples: 'The Orokaiva religious history is also particularly interesting here. Their traditional faith, Williams says, though in many respects vague and locally variable, concerned itself “primarily with the spirits of the dead” and their influence  on the welfare of the living. Death was appraised with particular realism, although it was considered ultimately as the result of supernatural causes. Magic had a consistent place. Orokaiva country, however, has been swept in modern times by a series of new cults indicative of religious adaptability in the face of fresh experience. First to come into prominence was the Baigona, or “snake cult” of 1911-12, succeeded from 1914 on by the so-called “Taro cult” which in turn had undergone a series of local reformulations by the time Williams reported on it in 1924.  Central features of the Taro cult were association of successful taro cultivation with the ancestral spirits, approached by way of a “shaking-fit” technique of revelation, together with somewhat new types of public ritual and symbols, including fragmentary elements from Christianity. Later Belshaw and others reported that “Christian Co-operative Evangelist” societies, which were developed by the Anglican Mission among some Orokaiva converts for the cooperative growing of rice and other crops, tended to assume a somewhat parallel and absorbing mystical agriculture context. Rumors spread of “an order from the King (of England) that co-operatives should be formed … (and that) as a result of their activities the white people would leave Papua and the villagers would be in charge of their own affairs.” This type of cooperative movement was stimulated after the war, and included putting crosses in the gardens, offering prayers before gardening activity, building special houses in which cooperators could meet and eat, and collecting money for vague purposes. Even in the face of Mission reluctance and some Orokaiva opposition, Government finally stepped in to try to give it better direction; a Cooperative officer was trying to bring the situation under control when the volcano exploded.' <sup id="cite_ref-129" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-129">[129]</a></sup> The specialists serving the Taro Cult are known as Taro men: 'Orokaiva shamans, or "taro men" serve as healers, weather magicians, and sorcerers.' <sup id="cite_ref-130" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-130">[130]</a></sup> The movement has produced leaders of intertribal renown: 'It is perhaps on law and organization that the Taro cult has the most significant effect, albeit a rudimentary and indefinite one. The voluntary acceptance of a new ritual, however lax, the observance of taboos, the necessity for probation, are all influences making for law and law-abidingness. More significant still is the elementary hierarchy which we have observed among the Taro men (p. 32). The existence of leaders in one tribe who are recognized by distant votaries of the cult in another tribe stands perhaps for a new idea among the Orokaiva. The absence of any political cohesion among and within the peoples of Papua has been remarked by others. It is conceivable that such a movement as Taro might give the initial impetus to some more or less spontaneous political organization.' <sup id="cite_ref-131" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-131">[131]</a></sup> It remains unclear whether Taro Men can be considered full-time specialists: 'While practically every one has been a willing convert to the Taro cult in so far as it meant participation in the song and feast, and while perhaps the majority have given way at some time or other to the pleasant abandonment of the jipari, there is a wide class of Taro experts or special exponents of the cult. It is impossible to set a definite limit to this class. There are some who are recognized as leaders and who are very strongly ‘possessed’, and others who are little more than laymen. However, it is possible to include them all under the name of ba-embo, which means literally ‘Taro man’. Such men, who, like the Baigona men, might be called priests of the cult, officiate and lead in the ceremonial feasting; they perform certain duties in the taro gardens; they make a special practice of jipari and similar contortions; and they subject themselves to certain taboos. The theory of their conduct is that of possession by a spirit, either of the taro itself or of the dead.' <sup id="cite_ref-132" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-132">[132]</a></sup>

The examples were such as the following: not to steal a man's vegetables, canoes, spears, &amp;c.; not to usurp his fishing rights; not to take his dog to hunt, but to drive it back if it followed the hunter of its own accord; not to commit adultery; not to beat one's wife overmuch; not to commit assault on another man. These igege were for adults; they did not apply to children, who had to be treated with so much indulgence; still less to dogs, whose nature it was to steal on sight.

The suppression by force which had marked the early contact phase gave way to a form of ‘indirect rule’ through the appointment of Village Constables. The earliest Village Constables were the strong, leading men who had confronted the Europeans as warriors. As time passed war leaders were no longer a feature of the society, but patrol reports indicate that by and large Village Constables were influential and effective in the maintenance of law and order. The position of Village Constables was an uncomfortable and interstitial one. They had the difficult task of attempting to juggle the interests of their relatives and exchange partners and of the Administration, so that both sides were reasonably happy most of the time. Between 1907 and 1914 the number of Village Constables in the Northern Division rose from fifty-four to eighty-three, indicating that this system of administration was satisfactory to the Australian authorities. The Village Constables were concerned with enforcing legislation which impinged upon many aspects of daily life: burial of the dead, upkeep of roads, construction of latrines, neatness of houses and so on. Failure to obey these regulations could lead to imprisonment.' <sup id="cite_ref-166" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-166">[166]</a></sup> The colonial authorities established prisons: 'Part of the setting up of a governmental organization was the establishment of gaols and the punishment of villagers who infringed the laws and regulations.

</p><p><b> ♠ Courts ♣ present ♥ </b> During the colonial period, foreign legal institutions became more relevant, with colonial magistrates fulfilling executive and judicial roles: 'Cases of imputed sorcery often come before the magistrate, but not a few of them, I believe, have to be dismissed as unproven. Some of these are deliberately trumped up, but many more are the outcome of mere groundless suspicion. It is probably true, moreover, that but a small proportion of the ‘cases’ are ever referred to the magistrate, for unless the evidence is very strong the native feels there is little hope of securing an indictment. Sorcery and magic, indeed, are often regarded as something a little beyond the ken of the matter-of-fact white man.' <sup id="cite_ref-168" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-168">[168]</a></sup> Courts were of colonial origin: 'The term pure ari is appropriate to describe the white man's labour if for no other reason than that a ‘job’ just like the pure is a place where one spends the day. The new dispensation has, sure enough, its own conflict (isoro) and mode of conflict resolution. Councillor-Colin brings this out by his example of the policeman who puts village men into handcuffs and takes them off to court. In such a case it was the task of the sorcerer to ensure that the men would escape conviction and be set free again.' <sup id="cite_ref-169" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-169">[169]</a></sup> Institutions remained informal on the village level: 'For those who remain in the village, the sanctioning mechanisms are mostly informal.

For in that chapter Mr. Williams deals with a phenomenon which has always appeared to me to be very difficult to understand, though it is common enough in Papua, and that is the well-ordered regulation of a peaceful society with apparently no government and no administration of justice to support it. There are no chiefs with any authority worth talking about among the Orokaiva, and the same is true of nearly the whole of Papua, and there are no Courts and no recognized method of enforcing native law or custom, and yet within the community, within what Mr. Williams calls the ‘sympathy group’, life is probably as peaceful and as orderly as it is with us. How this result can be obtained in the absence of any objective sanction is one of the puzzles of native administration.' <sup id="cite_ref-171" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-171">[171]</a></sup> Native offenders were tried by colonial courts instead.

<p><b> ♠ Communal buildings ♣ present ♥ </b> Most village buildings were residential: 'The Yega make three types of buildings each with a separate function; the vernacular names for these buildings are mando, dobo and gaga. The mando is the building where a man and his family normally live. It is a well-built structure about sixteen to twenty feet by twelve to sixteen feet, set on hardwood piles, with the floor about four feet above the ground. The framework is of untrimmed bush poles about four to six inches in diameter, nailed together (the fifty or sixty cents for nails is the only cash expense in building the house). The floor is of split lengths of limbom palm, laid with the convex trunk side uppermost so that there are no splinters. Walls are made of lengths of the two inch thick midrib of sago palm fronds lashed vertically. The lashing usually leaves a space of quarter to half an inch between each pair of strips allowing any cooling breeze to blow through at all times. The roof is thatched with sago-leaf ‘tiles’. The house is divided internally into two or three rooms, with a verandah in front.' <sup id="cite_ref-172" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-172">[172]</a></sup> 'In most instances the houses are set in two regular rows, facing one another. The space between, sporadically planted with coco-nut palms, is the scene of dances, plays, and intervillage scuffles. The old-fashioned house has been for the most part replaced by the ‘European’ model. This does not always mean any great change, save that the new house is loftier and airier and frequently possesses an annexe or ‘kitchen’ which seems as a rule to serve any purpose but a culinary one. But the general improvement is undeniable. The true native dwellings of the Orokaiva were so poor that W. E. Armit, an early resident magistrate, described them as ‘miserable little things, small ramshackle erections’, and referred to an Opi village as ‘a collection of squalid hovels’.' <sup id="cite_ref-173" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-173">[173]</a></sup> Villagers also constructed men's houses: 'BEFORE describing the dance and drama in detail it may be as well to set down a brief programme of events, i.e. the sequent stages of the festival. We may assume that the tabu is on the village and that it will remain until the occasion of the feast. If this feast is to be a considerable one, the first step will be the construction of an arijo, i.e. a men's house, which will be frequented by the men alone, and used for singing. This may be built a month or so before the festival, and from time to time the old-fashioned dancing (kuru) will take place in the open space before the arijo.' <sup id="cite_ref-174" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-174">[174]</a></sup>  'The men's house is called oro. If built in connexion with a ceremony and intended as a male club-house or what might be termed a concert-hall, the men's house is called specifically arijo; it will occupy a central position and be of more pretentious size-say 40 feet long; and it may boast some decoration in the form of frayed sago leaf hanging in fringes from the eaves. These arijo houses are not seen very frequently. A peculiar feature of one or two of them is an outward-sloping wall, which gives the edifice the contours of an oblong haystack. The ordinary oro, which is simply the regular domicile of the young bachelors, may be small and without any distinctive feature.' <sup id="cite_ref-175" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-175">[175]</a></sup>

A household tends to establish something like one and a half to two acres of garden per year. A garden is never used for more than one taro season, but as planting and consumption of the taro each tend to be stretched over most of a year, almost two years elapse between the clearing and final abandonment. This gives time for the bananas and sugar-cane to reach maturity too. Once a garden is abandoned, it is not used again for at least eight years or so. The usual swidden agriculture techniques are used, burning, clearing, careful removal of ‘rubbish’ remaining after the burning process, planting with a digging stick, periodic attention to weeding and heaping up of earth around growing taro, removal of corm-bearing bases of petioles of mature taro for removal and planting in a new garden. The Orokaiva practise no irrigation, no form of terracing or drainage, no manuring, no measures against parasites. Sometimes a fence is made out of tree trunks to keep pigs from breaking in.

<dd><b> ♠ markets ♣ inferred present ♥ </b> The foreign authorities established colonial settlements (see above), enabling trading relations with the Orokaiva population: 'European contact was to alter radically two major facets of pre-contact Orokaivan life. Forced pacification and compulsory labour would inhibit the scope of feasting and fighting. It would also open the path for the more regular association of different clans and tribes in the context of voluntary market exchange and government carrying and road work. This wider, peaceful association would modify the narrow moral universe. This was also to be challenged by the introduced missionaries, who would call on people to love all fellow humans.' <sup id="cite_ref-178" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-178">[178]</a></sup> [Even in colonial settlements, services were of a makeshift character.] Given the introduction of cash-cropping, we have assumed that Orokaiva farmers visited colonial markets occasionally.</dd>
<dd><b> ♠ food storage sites ♣ absent ♥ </b> According to SCCS variable 20 'Food Storage' 'Individual households', not 'Communal facilities', 'Political agent controlled repositories', or 'Economic agent controlled repositories' were present, coded in the SCCS as ‘2’. Roots and tubers were stored in yam-houses. [Ira Baschkow (pers. comm.): These were the property of individuals, usually men (though in some respects it might be more accurate to call them the property of married couple or households). Some yam houses had internal divisions such that the yams in different areas belonged to different persons, who were invariably related. Janice Newton (pers. comm.): By the 1970s there were no communal yam houses where I worked and display shelters of food were mainly of taro and bananas for special occasions such as end of mourning or puberty ceremonies.] 'While time devoted to taro cultivation always exceeds that of the other two crops, harvesting falls off markedly during the dry season. In contrast, the time devoted to the harvesting of sweet potato increases steadily through the survey, while that of yams is confined almost entirely to the wet season when large quantities are stored in specially constructed yam houses (or occasionally in holes in the ground).' <sup id="cite_ref-179" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-179">[179]</a></sup> 'The storing of yams is in the harau or yam-houses, seen commonly in many of the southern villages of the division. The harau usually takes the form of a small platform sheltered by a gabled roof in which there is a sort of attic. The platform is simply a place of social intercourse; the attic is the storehouse for yams. It is closed at either end, and thus dry and dark. When the yams are sprouting it is time for replanting.' <sup id="cite_ref-180" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-180">[180]</a></sup> 'A mere roofless platform is sometimes to be seen as a place of social intercourse. Among the southern tribes it is more usually combined with the picturesque little harau or yam-house, in which a small attic compartment above is the repository for the sprouting yams.' <sup id="cite_ref-181" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-181">[181]</a></sup> Other crops were accumulated for feasts: 'The fact that there is never real famine and that scarcity is a rare thing, brings about an attitude of mind which we might call improvidence. Yams are stored where they are grown; so also are Tauga nuts and Puga. But the two former are not common except in the south of the Division. Beyond these, and of course the coconut, the native puts by no vegetable food. When a feast is preparing, the taro will be gathered in great quantities and stacked on platforms. Some is eaten at the feast, some distributed with a great display of cordiality to the guests, who take it home. There is no method of preserving taro, and sometimes, when a feast is for any reason delayed, a great deal of food may deteriorate and become inedible.' <sup id="cite_ref-182" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-182">[182]</a></sup>  'Coco-nuts are accumulated, under strict taboo, for a feast. The huge coco-nut-laden tripod in the centre of the village, or the long lines of dry nuts on the ground, indicate that there is some entertainment pending towards which all the villagers will contribute. Sometimes one may see the tragedy of a feast over-long delayed and the nuts sprouting head high, too far gone to eat and perhaps too far gone to plant.' <sup id="cite_ref-183" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-183">[183]</a></sup> [The yams stored in yam houses were distinctly not constructed for the purpose of communal feasts only, but for feasts as well as general consumption. It was (and still is) usual for Orokaiva to plant special garden plots whose produce is earmarked for consumption or distribution at communal feasts, but the  main crop for that is taro, and usually the food is stored, basically, in the ground (it is left to continue "hardening" or "ripening" in the unharvested garden) until just several days before the feast will be held. There may be some regional variation involved, though.]</dd></dl>

The mission during this period seemed more detached from and independent of the Administration and commercial interests than it had been previously. However, structurally the mission became strongly tied to the Administration in the areas of medicine and education. The government encouraged such humanitarian activities as they improved relations between the colonized and colonizers but, lacking finance itself, was relieved that the mission took on most of the responsibility. So the Administration merely gave some financial subsidy and promoted the use of the growing mission services.  Government reports in 1909 stated that twenty-four schools were operating in the Northern Division. The first mission hospital was established at Buna  in 1913. In 1930, medical services were provided at six other small mission stations: Eroro, Sangara, Duvira, Gona, Isivita and Ambasi (see Fig. 2.4 and Wetherell 1977:241, 276, 311; Feetham 1917:13, 15; Shevill 1949:112, 110).' <sup id="cite_ref-184" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-184">[184]</a></sup> 'For the rest, the skills acquired by Orokaiva over the last 15 years are largely concerned not directly with village development but rather with an increase of understanding of the world outside. While before the war, only a small minority had school education, the Anglican Mission spread its operations to several new stations, including Sasembata, after the war. After the eruption, the scope of education was again greatly extended and it could be said that the eruption marked the beginning of universal school education in the majority of Orokaiva villages.' <sup id="cite_ref-185" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-185">[185]</a></sup> [Even in colonial settlements, services were of a makeshift character.]

The Orokaiva intially relied on trails: '(a) As an Identity Token. So far I have not mentioned the uses of the plant emblem. If one asks a native what he actually does with his heratu, he will assuredly answer: ‘I place it on the track so that others who may follow may know I have passed that way.’ This, indeed, though not the only use for the heratu, is the commonest. At the juncture of two paths I have come upon eight different kinds of leaves or grass, placed there during the morning and as yet scarcely wilted. My boys, who were inhabitants of the district, were able to identify each clan by its heratu; the owners of them had passed this spot at intervals, all bound for one village as guests to a feast and dance. The stem of the leaf, the root of the grass, or the butt of the branch, should point in the direction which its owner has taken, but apparently this rule is not observed with strictness.' <sup id="cite_ref-186" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-186">[186]</a></sup> But the colonial authorities carried out a compulsory roadbuilding scheme, conscripting native labour: 'When the Papuan Act was passed in 1905 by the Australian Commonwealth Parliament, it provided a legal framework for the Australian Administration in the whole of the Territory, of which Northern Division was a part.

<dd><b> ♠ Bridges ♣ present ♥ </b> According to SCCS variable 14 'Routes of Land Transport' only ‘1’ or 'unimproved trails' were used for land transport, not roads. The Orokaiva constructed wooden bridges or gangways: 'Bridges. Formerly, I am told, stretches of swamp were spanned by single logs supported on cross-trestles. The modern type of this bridge has an adzed surface to make walking safer, and is certainly preferable to the other style (viz. a raised gangway with clumsily laid cross-pieces) until, as is so often the case, the log is found to be slippery and aslant. Small creeks are crossed by single tree-trunks, over which the native, a fearless balancer, walks without misgiving, despite the queer and disconcerting vibrations set up by his footsteps on a long log.' <sup id="cite_ref-188" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-188">[188]</a></sup> By the time of the Mt. Lamington eruption, the colonial authorities had built bridges for its own infrastructural needs: 'When the volcano erupted on 21 January 1951, Koropatans noticed the dark smoke and cloud and saw ash and stones carried through the air. The survivors including the sick moved to Wairope on the Kumusi bridge. A married couple from Koropata, Stephenson Kareka and Flora Amaupa, evoked the scene: ‘There was no water and no food as both had been spoiled by the lava and ash. The government supplied food.

The battle of the Coral Sea in May thwarted a sea invasion, so the Japanese attempted a land invasion of Port Moresby. In July 1942 they landed between Buna and Gona on the Northern Division coast (Robinson 1979:12). Individual battles such as those on the Kokoda Trail, which became part of the Australian national mythology, have merged in the minds of Papua New Guinean villagers.

<dl><dd><b> ♠ Ceremonial site ♣ present ♥ </b> Men's houses fulfilled ceremonial functions: 'BEFORE describing the dance and drama in detail it may be as well to set down a brief programme of events, i.e. the sequent stages of the festival. We may assume that the tabu is on the village and that it will remain until the occasion of the feast. If this feast is to be a considerable one, the first step will be the construction of an arijo, i.e. a men's house, which will be frequented by the men alone, and used for singing. This may be built a month or so before the festival, and from time to time the old-fashioned dancing (kuru) will take place in the open space before the arijo.' <sup id="cite_ref-191" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-191">[191]</a></sup> Villagers erected tabu posts and performed dances in open spaces: 'Of the three main uses of the heratu previously described, viz. (1) as an identity token, (2) as a mark of individual abstinence, (3) as the naterari, or village tabu post, the last will seem tolerably clear. The naterari stands as a symbol of the dead man in whose behalf the tabu is imposed. Formerly it may have been something more than a formal symbol of the dead, in fact a crude image. This association between the wooden post and the dead man which it represents is strengthened by using his particular namesake tree: then, besides other associations, the two have this important bond between them-a common name.' <sup id="cite_ref-192" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-192">[192]</a></sup> 'In most instances the houses are set in two regular rows, facing one another. The space between, sporadically planted with coco-nut palms, is the scene of dances, plays, and intervillage scuffles. The old-fashioned house has been for the most part replaced by the ‘European’ model. This does not always mean any great change, save that the new house is loftier and airier and frequently possesses an annexe or ‘kitchen’ which seems as a rule to serve any purpose but a culinary one. But the general improvement is undeniable. The true native dwellings of the Orokaiva were so poor that W. E. Armit, an early resident magistrate, described them as ‘miserable little things, small ramshackle erections’, and referred to an Opi village as ‘a collection of squalid hovels’.' <sup id="cite_ref-193" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-193">[193]</a></sup> Other structures are erected for initiates and taro men: 'Seclusion is practised by all the tribes, north and south; and it appears that the same general rules are observed in all cases. The house of seclusion, removed a little distance from the village, stands in a small enclosure (sama) fenced about with palm-leaf barriers some thirteen or fourteen feet in height. The house is called oro (Aiga) and may in some instances, I am told, accommodate both boy and girl candidates; for it is said that they are all ‘brothers and sisters’ and may, therefore, be trusted to behave. Usually, however, those who arrange the matter are less trusting, and the two sexes are confined separately. One house of seclusion which I saw was about 9 feet by 15 feet in area and consisted of a single large room in which nine boys were confined. The house was closed in on all sides and the eyes of the inmates seemed very wide in the perpetual semi-darkness. The secluded children are called i-tekari-mei, ‘The children who are shut up above’, or simply i-mei, ‘the on-top children’. They occupy the upper part of a pile house, the actual ground floor of which is used by the old men who [Page 185] look after them. They discard all ornaments, but it seems, nowadays at least, to be a matter of indifference whether or no they wear a bo. They must not wash, and it is said to be the proper thing to keep the house warm by a fire underneath; though this, I believe, is not meant as a trial to the initiates, but rather to make them comfortable. Whenever they please they may exercise themselves in the sama enclosure, and occasionally they go farther afield in the bush.' <sup id="cite_ref-194" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-194">[194]</a></sup> 'Possibly a special platform or house, a sort of bandstand, has been erected for the occasion. This is called ba oro, i.e. ‘Taro men's house’, and is meant for the somewhat exclusive use of the accredited Taro men during the day, and for the chorus which is to continue throughout the night. The singers will crowd about a fire in the centre of the floor; if the night be cold, they will sit more comfortably in the ascending heat of fires on the ground beneath. One man after another leads, singing a stave or two with the truly musical voice of the Orokaiva, and as, or almost before, he finishes, the whole chorus bursts forth with the refrain. The drums beat the distinctive Taro rhythm, viz. two equal beats followed by a pause equivalent to one of them, or time of three with the third beat missed. This rhythm, I believe, is used throughout the whole Division by the Taro singers, and, as far as I know, exclusively. It is the same rhythm as that of the dance baruga, practised long previous to the advent of Taro, save that it is considerably slower. According to one informant, the Taro measure had been specified, like other details of the cult, in a dream. The drums are tuned with no little care, the lizard skin being tautened with lumps of beeswax until the correct tone is obtained. Shell trumpets are blown by one or two boys, whose enthusiasm is not unequal to the immense staying power which this instrument demands; but too often the shell trumpet, which admits of no tuning, shatters the harmony of the concert, and one can understand why a distracted missionary lit his Primus stove and placed it by his reading-lamp so that its roar might drown the discords of the kasamba.' <sup id="cite_ref-195" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-195">[195]</a></sup></dd>

There may be an enclosure, java hamboru, in or on the outskirts of the village, where they may rehearse in private. (Note that this java hamboru may be in the village where the feast and dance are to take place, or in another village. The latter is frequently the case because the dance is commonly performed by visitors who have previously undertaken to present it. They therefore rehearse in their own village, and stage the finished performance in the village where the festival is taking place.)' <sup id="cite_ref-197" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-197">[197]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b> ♠ Mines or quarries ♣ present ♥ </b> The colonial authorities organized mining operations with a focus on precious metals: 'In response to Australian pressure, the British government annexed Papua in 1888. Gold was discovered shortly thereafter, resulting in a major movement of prospectors and miners to what was then the Northern District. Relations with the Papuans were bad from the start, and there were numerous killings on both sides. The Protectorate of British New Guinea became Australian territory by the passing of the Papua Act of 1905 by the Commonwealth Government of Australia. The new administration adopted a policy of peaceful penetration, and many measures of social and economic national development were introduced. Local control was in the hands of village constables, paid servants of the Crown. Chosen by European officers, they were intermediaries between the government and the people. In 1951 an eruption occurred on Mount Lamington, completely devastating a large part of the area occupied by the Orokaiva.' <sup id="cite_ref-198" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-198">[198]</a></sup> Orokaiva men were recruited for labour in the mines: 'None of the cash crop or natural resource industries developed in the Division had fulfilled expectations. Nevertheless, the mining industry had survived, the number of plantations continued to grow and the resident European population increased. All of these factors influenced the working habits of the Orokaivans, in spite of the fact that they still controlled the bulk of their village land. A considerable number of Orokaivan men went to work on plantations, in mines and in European houses. In 1924 a Resident Magistrate commented that a large number of the male population had already worked on plantations or in stores, or had been members of the police force (see Table 2.4 and Flint 1926:44).' <sup id="cite_ref-199" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-199">[199]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b> ♠ Other site ♣ present ♥ </b> Garden shelters were household-based, but tree houses served a communal defensive purpose: 'The Yega build one other form of dwelling, a garden shelter (dobo) usually roughly constructed with leaf walls, frequently open at one end and often so low from floor to roof that a person cannot stand erect in it. A dobo is a temporary dwelling, built near the swidden in current use, and used by a man and his family for up to a week at a time while they are working in their gardens, which may be three or four miles from the village. The dobo is also used to shelter from rain or to take a siesta during shorter, one-day visits to the garden.' <sup id="cite_ref-200" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-200">[200]</a></sup> 'Of tree houses (savai), which were formerly common enough, I have seen no evidence in the whole Division, [Page 71] except for certain large trees which are said to have supported them in less reposeful days. They were not fighting-tops so much as places of refuge in which a surprised village might keep its assailants at bay until the blasts of the wooden trumpets brought help from surrounding allies. They were built in the branches of large trees in or near the village (sometimes in several adjacent trees connected with cane gangways), and were furnished with cane-ladders or ‘legs’ (savai-tei). The stockade provided another means of defence, though this too has disappeared with the coming of the King's peace.' <sup id="cite_ref-201" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-201">[201]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<dd><b> ♠ Time ♣ present ♥ </b> Agricultural activities followed natural cycles: 'The Inonda people refer to the dry season as huvira because the huvira tree (Erythrina indica) flowers at that time. The wet season is divided into a number of periods which are recognized by the ripening of various nuts (especially hauga) and edible pit-pit (ina), and by the flowering of the garepa tree. For instance, the garepa season begins about November or December and lasts for two or three months. These are the wettest months of the year and plant growth is therefore rapid at that time. The pasiro (a variety of pit-pit) ripens about March, which is a time of more moderate rainfall. Food is in abundance at this period, and it is accordingly the most popular season for feasting.' <sup id="cite_ref-202" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-202">[202]</a></sup> 'The gardening tasks are done at a moderate pace which is pleasurable. Rushing and heavy burdens are avoided when possible, but when they are necessary they are classified as ‘toil’ (pure gaiha) and people rest later to make up for it. The only time measures used are: early morning, midday, afternoon (meaning: time to go home) and evening-night (meaning: after supper).' <sup id="cite_ref-203" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-203">[203]</a></sup> Secular and religious calendars of European origin were superimposed on the native system: 'In recent years, two further calendars have become superimposed upon the traditional one: that of the Christian festivals and that of the European economy, notably monthly coffee sales from June to December and the payment of Local Government Council tax supposedly in September.' <sup id="cite_ref-204" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-204">[204]</a></sup> 'The weekly pattern. The Sivepe people speak of Wednesdays as ‘Mission day’ (for work at Sasembata mission station), Fridays as ‘Council day’ (for road maintenance and cleaning the village) and Sundays as a day of rest and attendance at church services. Of the remaining days, Monday and Tuesday are devoted to cash cropping, and Thursday and Saturday to subsistence. They claim to have been directed by the Higaturu Local Government Council to work according to this routine and while it is not strictly adhered to, the concept of the week is firmly implanted in the Orokaiva mind (see Table 6:9).' <sup id="cite_ref-205" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-205">[205]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b> ♠ Geometrical ♣ inferred absent ♥ </b> The sources reviewed are not coded for any weights and measures. Schwimmer's later material on numeracy and linguistic differences suggests that no geometry was present: 'For the rest, the skills acquired by Orokaiva over the last 15 years are largely concerned not directly with village development but rather with an increase of understanding of the world outside. While before the war, only a small minority had school education, the Anglican Mission spread its operations to several new stations, including Sasembata, after the war. After the eruption, the scope of education was again greatly extended and it could be said that the eruption marked the beginning of universal school education in the majority of Orokaiva villages. The Sasembata station began to draw virtually the entire child population of the surrounding villages, and most students now follow a five or six year course. While this development had been planned ever since the war, it may be significant that regular school attendance of all the villages in the district was experienced for the first time at Ilimo, where a school was conducted for the whole evacuee child population, and adult classes as well. It is the objective of present school programmes, as far as I can see, to make the population literate and the increase of literacy is a major aspect of acculturation over the period. Literacy has certainly progressed to a point where letters written in Orokaiva to any family in Sivepe can be read and understood with the help of at least a junior member of the family; and can be replied to. While I could see no evidence that people have acquired mathematical knowledge of any sophistication, I was struck by a strong quantitative orientation. In the Orokaiva language, there are no numerals higher than 2; hence, it is the invariable practise to use English numerals when speaking the Orokaiva language. The numerals are, in fact, among the main English linquistic features that have been borrowed. They are used with remarkable frequency; the number of coffee trees, the value in pounds of trade goods included in a bride price, the calculation of money prices, even the number of brothers or men who together played some role in a mythological tale (a distinctly contemporary touch, this)-all these phenomena show that “numbers” have become an integral part of Orokaiva culture. The Orokaiva use the English word “number” for a variety of quantitative concepts, including price. Finally, one must regard as an aspect of acculturation, the introduction of many [Page 80] concepts drawn from the scene of world affairs. While among the Orokaiva, I heard talk about Vietnam, Indonesia, Africa, India. The political orientation displayed was a mild kind of nationalism, and a sense of closeness to newly independent non-white states. But the information, derived from radio broadcasts and speeches by councillors, introduced an acculturative kind of perspective.

When a hungry man sees a ripe bunch of bananas in the garden of his friend he will not hesitate to help himself. It is to be feared that he would not hesitate over long if he met-the same temptation in the garden of a stranger.

The official in charge of the scheme visited each village to make the payments. The ordinance required that payment was to be made in proportion to days worked and, as the village constable who was in charge of the plantation was almost invariably illiterate, some of them kept an “attendance stick” for each man. A notch was cut in the stick for each day of absence other than that caused by illness or the death of a close relative. When the government officer visited the village to make the payments the constable produced the attendance stick of each man as he came up for payment. Some constables relied on memory to inform government officers of absentees, but the few literate ones (e. g. at Sombo) were provided with attendance books.' <sup id="cite_ref-209" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-209">[209]</a></sup></dd>

To become fully married the single men had to become the meat-givers to the single girls who swept, harvested and cooked for them. Brothers showed lineage solidarity and co-operation, and husbands and wives ideally established a balanced exchange of services. Themes such as these reassert themselves in the fishing and hunting activities of the Koropatans today.' <sup id="cite_ref-210" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-210">[210]</a></sup> 'As in many parts of Melanesia, pigs in Koropata are extremely important for feasts and in some senses they represent or sybmolize human beings. Speaking of the Orokaivan Sivepe people, Schwimmer has noted that a gift of pig meat restores relations after a quarrel, and establishes new social relations. He suggests that pig sacrifice can be seen as communion with primeval ancestral beings (Schwimmer 1973:138-9, 145, 148, 153). In Koropata too the gift of pig meat can be used to emphasize the strength and importance of a particular social relationship. The creation myth told by Koropatans is centred on Totoima, a pig-man figure with long teeth (cf. Schwimmer 1973:55). His death and subsequent division into pieces represents the origin of the different language groups around the Orokaiva area. There are examples of pig-man association in myth, ritual and exchange throughout Melanesia. Societies project humanity on to pigs in contexts as varied as myths and compensation payments (see Modjeska 1977; Meggitt 1974) and in the household situation of raising pigs.' <sup id="cite_ref-211" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-211">[211]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b> ♠ Lists, tables, and classifications ♣ present ♥ </b> The Constabulary relied on ad hoc devices rather than written lists when administering government plantations, but there was a literate minority using attendance books: 'The producer's half of the income from the coffee was paid, not on delivery, but at the end of each year. The official in charge of the scheme visited each village to make the payments. The ordinance required that payment was to be made in proportion to days worked and, as the village constable who was in charge of the plantation was almost invariably illiterate, some of them kept an “attendance stick” for each man. A notch was cut in the stick for each day of absence other than that caused by illness or the death of a close relative. When the government officer visited the village to make the payments the constable produced the attendance stick of each man as he came up for payment. Some constables relied on memory to inform government officers of absentees, but the few literate ones (e. g. at Sombo) were provided with attendance books.' <sup id="cite_ref-215" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-215">[215]</a></sup></dd>

The wet season is divided into a number of periods which are recognized by the ripening of various nuts (especially hauga) and edible pit-pit (ina), and by the flowering of the garepa tree. For instance, the garepa season begins about November or December and lasts for two or three months. These are the wettest months of the year and plant growth is therefore rapid at that time. The pasiro (a variety of pit-pit) ripens about March, which is a time of more moderate rainfall. Food is in abundance at this period, and it is accordingly the most popular season for feasting.' <sup id="cite_ref-216" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-216">[216]</a></sup> During the colonial period, European calendars were superimposed on the native system: 'In recent years, two further calendars have become superimposed upon the traditional one: that of the Christian festivals and that of the European economy, notably monthly coffee sales from June to December and the payment of Local Government Council tax supposedly in September.' <sup id="cite_ref-217" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-217">[217]</a></sup> 'The weekly pattern. The Sivepe people speak of Wednesdays as ‘Mission day’ (for work at Sasembata mission station), Fridays as ‘Council day’ (for road maintenance and cleaning the village) and Sundays as a day of rest and attendance at church services. Of the remaining days, Monday and Tuesday are devoted to cash cropping, and Thursday and Saturday to subsistence. They claim to have been directed by the Higaturu Local Government Council to work according to this routine and while it is not strictly adhered to, the concept of the week is firmly implanted in the Orokaiva mind (see Table 6:9).' <sup id="cite_ref-218" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-218">[218]</a></sup></dd>

In the early years of the mission any promising pupil, with two or more years of elementary schooling, might be chosen for training as a mission teacher. Certainly he would get some coaching in how to teach school, but the emphasis was above all religious. More recently, a number of courses were set up by government and mission teachers were encouraged to enter for such courses. The A course is open to men with a Standard 6 education and takes one year. The B course is open to men with a Form 2 education and takes two years. The administration insists on an A certificate as a minimum qualification; in the Northern District, new appointees were usually expected to have a B certificate. The mission is less fortunate; in 1966 in the Northern District, only 97 out of 274 mission teachers had either an A or a B certificate. Out of the Sasembata staff of 12, five were trained; out of the Hohota staff of four, one was trained.' <sup id="cite_ref-219" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-219">[219]</a></sup> By the time of the eruption of Mt. Lamington, some Orokaiva communities were fairly familiar with Biblical themes: 'Certainly, the eruption would be followed by a resolve not to make the harsh power that brought the eruption angry again. Whether this power was primarily identified with God or with Sumbiripa is extremely hard to tell; it is even harder to tell whether these powers were viewed as being entirely distinct. Father Albert's testimony strongly suggests that the eruption was treated as symbolic of divine wroth as it was presented in the Bible.' <sup id="cite_ref-220" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-220">[220]</a></sup> But Schwimmer's other comments (see above) suggest significant time-lags in the spread of literacy.</dd>

Visiting the coast, these inlanders will even take calabashes and bring them home full of sea-water. The only means of obtaining it locally is by burning certain leaves and the husks of coco-nut or Tauga nuts. Over a layer of dry wood are set a number of large pottery fragments, and over these again are piled the leaves and husks. Ignited, the pile smokes abundantly, and when it has burnt away leaves a residue of [Page 65] ash in the pottery fragments.

Shell beads served as tokens of exchange in brideprice negotiations: 'Traditional valuables. The possession of hambo (bone and shell ornaments) and di (feather headdress) may give some indication of a man's adherence to traditional values. In traditional Orokaiva society the possession of such valuables demonstrated wealth and prowess, but this function is now being taken over by money, as the relative importance of cash as the means of procuring desirable products increases, and money transactions become more frequent. Hambo and di are inherited through the father and sometimes other relatives, and they are usually distributed among the surviving sons. It is difficult to assess the traditional valuables owned by any one individual, as a man often looks after his younger brothers' shares and more than one person, both within and without the nuclear family, may have rights to the hambo and di kept in a particular household.' <sup id="cite_ref-222" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-222">[222]</a></sup> 'Traditional bridewealth exchanges in Papua New Guinea invariably incorporated important valuables symbolizing male and female qualities and duties, the linking of two kinship groups or family networks and so on. The modern stress on cash seems almost an obsession. Orokaiva brideprice includes traditional goods such as pigs and taro, and sometimes feather head-dresses and shell necklaces. But it is the cash component which dominates the aggressive demands and which becomes a focus of talk in the village.' <sup id="cite_ref-223" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-223">[223]</a></sup> 'In the first case this was the exchange between man and woman in making their own contributions and deriving their own benefits in the taro garden - a cycle of exchange which parallels the cultivation cycle of the taro itself. In the second case it was the exchange between clansmen which is complete only when the man who received the brideprice provides recruits for the clan, as well as a steady new affinal alliance. It does not concern me here whether psychologists would, in such cases, accept the exchange breakdown as the real cause of the social breakdown; I have illustrated that the Orokaiva view social breakdowns in this manner.' <sup id="cite_ref-224" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-224">[224]</a></sup></dd>

The dates given in Newton's and Schwimmer's materials suggest that credit structures were introduced only after World War II and the eruption of Mt. Lamington: 'The Administration continued to promote economic development as well as to aid the rehabilitation of both Australian and Papua New Guinean ex-servicemen. Land bought by Australians immediately after the war was used in 1958 for a scheme to provide land and credit for ex-servicemen. The loans to the 131 Papuan and New Guinean servicemen totalled £112,550 whereas loans totalling £3,120,000 were given to 141 European ex-servicemen. The Europeans in the scheme had large 400-500 acre blocks of which there were twenty-nine in Northern Division, whereas the Papuans had small-holder blocks of 25 to 30 acres, of which there were seventy-eight in Northern Division (Howlett 1965:4, 5, 9, 56).' <sup id="cite_ref-227" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-227">[227]</a></sup> 'Although there is provision in the Territory for credit assistance for economic development, small growers of cash crops such as are found in Sivepe and Inonda are not eligible for this credit.

Part of the proceeds of produce sales was distributed to villagers and part was deposited in a fund to be used for specific purposes including education. The project was resumed for a short time after the war and a credit balance remained in the Sangara Native Coffee Trust Fund. This money was used as part payment for the purchase of hulling, winnowing and polishing machines for the factory. The balance was met by a loan from the Native Loans Board (which is an agency of the central government). A factory building was erected for the council by an indigenous contractor at a cost of £500. The building was completed and the machinery installed by January 1959. Until this time the processing and marketing of coffee had been undertaken by a private firm.' <sup id="cite_ref-229" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-229">[229]</a></sup> We have adopted 1920 as a provisional date of transition.</dd>

According to Schwimmer's later material, native wealth items and money were stored on the household level: 'As with the Siane, the Orokaiva tend to store pound notes in treasure boxes, with di and hambo, and to keep them for special purposes which are often ceremonial (payment of brideprice, giving of feasts and church donations), but sometimes utilitarian (payment of taxes). Purchases in trade stores are mostly for luxury items, i.e. objects which the Orokaiva use only when there are guests to be entertained (tinned meat and fish, sugar, tea, batteries, cartridges, kerosene and tobacco, for example). Foods like rice, bread and flour are classifiable as luxuries among the hill people, as here they are used exclusively as guest foods. It is clear, however, from Waddell and Krinks' statistics that on the alluvial plains near Popondetta, rice and flour is bought in far greater quantity in months when taro is in short supply. These products are thus taking the place of subsidiary crops. People in this area prefer to make money from cash crops and services and to spend some of their cash on supplementary staples. The Siane, at the time of Salisbury's research, did not depend on cash as a source of staple food.' <sup id="cite_ref-230" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-230">[230]</a></sup> This can be presumed for the latter half of the colonial period as well, given the introduction of taxation and the gradual monetization of the economy.</dd></dl>

Both are called hui. The principal use of the hui is for making sound-signals, such as the alarm of war, the announcement of a death, or the approach of a party bearing a pig.

While before the war, only a small minority had school education, the Anglican Mission spread its operations to several new stations, including Sasembata, after the war. After the eruption, the scope of education was again greatly extended and it could be said that the eruption marked the beginning of universal school education in the majority of Orokaiva villages. The Sasembata station began to draw virtually the entire child population of the surrounding villages, and most students now follow a five or six year course. While this development had been planned ever since the war, it may be significant that regular school attendance of all the villages in the district was experienced for the first time at Ilimo, where a school was conducted for the whole evacuee child population, and adult classes as well. It is the objective of present school programmes, as far as I can see, to make the population literate and the increase of literacy is a major aspect of acculturation over the period. Literacy has certainly progressed to a point where letters written in Orokaiva to any family in Sivepe can be read and understood with the help of at least a junior member of the family; and can be replied to. While I could see no evidence that people have acquired mathematical knowledge of any sophistication, I was struck by a strong quantitative orientation. In the Orokaiva language, there are no numerals higher than 2; hence, it is the invariable practise to use English numerals when speaking the Orokaiva language. The numerals are, in fact, among the main English linquistic features that have been borrowed. They are used with remarkable frequency; the number of coffee trees, the value in pounds of trade goods included in a bride price, the calculation of money prices, even the number of brothers or men who together played some role in a mythological tale (a distinctly contemporary touch, this)-all these phenomena show that “numbers” have become an integral part of Orokaiva culture. The Orokaiva use the English word “number” for a variety of quantitative concepts, including price. Finally, one must regard as an aspect of acculturation, the introduction of many [Page 80] concepts drawn from the scene of world affairs.

<dd><b> ♠ Slings ♣ present ♥ </b> The Sling. The sling (taiha) is said to have been once a genuine weapon, yet the early reports contain no mention of it as being used by the hostile natives. W. E. Armit speaks of the men of the Upper Kumusi and Yodda river as ‘stone-throwers and rushing natives’,  but other stories tell of the natives sometimes attacking with no weapons save large stones which they had picked up on the track, and there is no reason to suppose that the stone-throwers mentioned by Mr. Armit threw with anything but their hands. Now, at any rate, the sling is little more than a toy, though why elderly men should sometimes carry these playthings in their bags I have not been able to discover. In the typical example the pouch is of roughly netted string (Plate XVIIIb). Of the attached strings one is in the form of a loop, which is passed round a finger; the other is released in throwing.<sup id="cite_ref-243" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-243">[243]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b> ♠ Self bow ♣ suspected unknown ♥ </b> The use of bows and arrows has been reported for other Papua New Guinean societies, such as the Wola: 'Food. Highlanders were able to meet their food requirements easily and with scarcely any direct use of flaked lithics. Garden vegetables are available all year and the domestic pig is the main source of meat. Some animals are hunted, but hunting is not important to subsistence (Pospisil 1963; Salisbury 1962; Sillitoe 2001). Wild pig is the largest and most dangerous animal hunted and people use their most effective weapons to hunt it, or employ other techniques such as trapping. Though hunting is relatively danger-free, the same equipment is used for warfare, thus relating it to danger. Hunting equipment comprises bows and arrows hafted with slivers of bamboo and palm. Stone arrowheads were not made. There is no connection between perilous activities and stone which might enhance its status. The all-important agricultural tools are made predominantly of wood. Not only is more care taken with these extractive tools, they also take considerably longer to make (e.g. digging sticks took on average four hours using stone tools) (Sillitoe 1988).' <sup id="cite_ref-244" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-244">[244]</a></sup> This code may therefore be in need of reconsideration.</dd>

During World War I, Papua New Guinea almost escaped the violence. A semblance of military combat between an Australian force and German soldiers at Bitapaka, New Britain, lasted only one day […] Significantly, New Guinean police did most of the fighting and dying for the Germans. Among those who fought, 30 died from rifle fire, 10 were wounded, and 56 were taken prisoners (Mackenzie 1987, 73-74; Burnell 1915). Germany’s New Guinea possessions, then known as the “old protectorate”, included the northeast portion of the mainland, the Bismarck Archipelago, and Bougainville. They came under Australian military rule in September 1914 and remained subject to the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force (ANMEF) until civil administration was restored on 9 May 1921.

<dl><dd> <b> ♠ War clubs ♣ present ♥ </b> Stone Clubs. Stone clubs are of two principal kinds, the ‘pineapple’ (gishi) and the disk (emi). They are made from river pebbles. The former variety has a hole through the longer axis for the haft, and its striking surface is serrated by means of longitudinal and lateral grooves, which leave a number of processes or points. The latter is more or less disk-shaped, the outer edge being ground down to a fairly sharp cutting-edge.<sup id="cite_ref-250" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-250">[250]</a></sup> Wooden ‘Swords’. The wooden sword (asivo) is a blade-shaped length of black palm-wood usually some 3 feet 6 inches long. The point and edges are not so sharp as to pierce or cut, and the weapon is virtually a club. Being used with two hands, it is much less unwieldy than the stone-headed club, and probably gains in effectiveness by its lightness. The asivo is often painted and befeathered.<sup id="cite_ref-251" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-251">[251]</a></sup></dd>
<dd> <b> ♠ Battle axes ♣ present ♥ </b> As the miners and carriers moved into Gira River and Yodda Valley districts there was more violence between villagers and intruders. Over a period of about 18 months, large numbers of Kumusi villagers joined with the Kokoda people to attack miners and storekeepers nearly every week. Resident Magistrate Armit intervened in an attempt to reduce the tension, but in various encounters with parties of Orokavians armed with stones, spears and tomahawks, he shot between fifty and sixty.<sup id="cite_ref-252" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-252">[252]</a></sup></dd>

The principal weapon is the spear, of which several varieties are distinguished.<sup id="cite_ref-254" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-254">[254]</a></sup> One or two varieties of hard-woods are used for spears, but these weapons as well as the wooden ‘sword’ are usually made from the tough and springy Koropa palm.<sup id="cite_ref-255" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-255">[255]</a></sup>  The significance of warfare to Orokaivan men is obvious but several descriptions suggest that Orokaivan women were also directly involved. Women had their own weapon, a quarterstaff ‘poreha’ (Williams 1930:163) and on at least one occasion joined in with the men in spear fighting. On most occasions it seems that women used only their staffs and fought alongside men in aggressive sham fights between clans (Waiko 1972, Williams 1930:162-163). They were more noted for their verbal contribution. The people most difficult to pacify were women, who, while doing little actual violence with their … quarterstaffs, were very successfully inciting to violence with their tongues (Williams 1930:163).<sup id="cite_ref-256" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-256">[256]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b> ♠ Wood, bark, etc ♣ present ♥ </b> [NB: only in shields.] The Shield. The shield (beha or pere) is made of light wood, about ½ inch thick, strongly bound with narrow strips of cane to prevent splitting. The handle is a loop of stout rattan which passes through the wood. The shape of the shield-square cut above and pointed below-caused early observers to refer to it very appropriately as ‘Gothic’. It sometimes bears a device-in no manner heraldic but purely decorative-made by interlacing black strands among the yellow cane binding strips; and when this is well done the effect may be artistic and even dainty (Plate XIX)... Shields are used very adroitly in turning or intercepting missiles, and a broken spear-point buried in the wood is regarded as a trophy. Despite the fact that their serious use is over they are still very commonly kept in readiness-at least by the Aiga-and they always make a fracas possible.

But nowadays [1923] pacification has brought about a tendency to scatter in small isolated groups.<sup id="cite_ref-264" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-264">[264]</a></sup> Norton (1962:6) says that sometimes villages, which ‘are known to have been quite large’ and stockaded (cf.

</p><p>'Some descriptions suggest that the purpose of warfare may have been to secure better land, but this was by no means always the case. Many wars were over the breach of tribal boundaries and the violation of hunting rights (Chinnery and Beaver 1917:158, 160; Waiko 1972a:12, 24)... Good land and security from attack almost certainly affected choice in area of settlement. However, the Orokaivan area is not densely populated so land shortage cannot be posited as a main cause of warfare.  The uncentralized fragmentary political system relied on buffer zones between hamlets and villages. Tracts of unused land were therefore a feature of this system, marked by dispersion, splitting and war, and could be seen as exemplifying the under-use of resources which Sahlins (1972:42-51) claims for his domestic mode of production... Factors other than land shortage encouraged fighting. Youths may not have ‘lusted for a fight’ or ‘burned to distinguish themselves’ (Chinnery and Beaver 1917:159, 160) but homicide was the mark of an initiated man. A death usually demanded vengeance, so the cycle of killing and revenge was self-perpetuating. Quarrels could begin with minor matters such as garden theft, or wife beating when the wife's kinsmen came to her support. The various Orokaiva groups constantly sought to maintain their own structural position, their strength and authority, while simultaneously attempting to limit the dominance of other similar groups. Thus, fighting was an important means by which a social group continued to survive (Waiko 1972a; Chinnery and Beaver 1917:158-60).'<sup id="cite_ref-289" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-289">[289]</a></sup>

A semblance of military combat between an Australian force and German soldiers at Bitapaka, New Britain, lasted only one day […] Significantly, New Guinean police did most of the fighting and dying for the Germans.

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Kekesi cult rites ♥</b> 'I witnessed the rites of Kekesi on November 26, 1914. They were performed with every appearance of sincerity and fanaticism. The man Yavevi conducted the ceremony, and seemed to be under the hypnotic influence of the man Bia, who remained throughout silent and carefully watching us. When the proceedings at all dragged, Bia would instil enthusiasm  by throwing himself into a fit of convulsions from the waist upwards, jumping violently up and down while remaining in a sitting posture, and babbling unintelligibly, the saliva dropping from his mouth. In this condition he would be joined by Yavevi and some of the other men, whilst those remaining unaffected would redouble their efforts. Yavevi and Bia revived automatically, and Yavevi conducted the others through their prayer-like devotions. At the end of December the whole of the people of the Gira from the coast to Tabara and the Eia River in the west were performing the Kekesi rites as described above, with additional songs.' <sup id="cite_ref-306" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-306">[306]</a></sup></dd>

The drums beat the distinctive Taro rhythm, viz. two equal beats followed by a pause equivalent to one of them, or time of three with the third beat missed. This rhythm, I believe, is used throughout the whole Division by the Taro singers, and, as far as I know, exclusively. It is the same rhythm as that of the dance baruga, practised long previous to the advent of Taro, save that it is considerably slower."<sup id="cite_ref-332" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-332">[332]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Embahi separation ceremony ♥</b> 'Initiates are brought from the bush into the village. Having entered the village, they form two advancing lines until a large scaffolding is reached, erected at one end of the village. Turning, the men kneel down facing the entrance from which they have come and remain in this position, still keeping silence. It is at this stage that the candidates are presented. Faint cries arise from the bush, becoming louder and louder, and the words “Shi! Shi!” mingled with yells and shrieks are distinguished, and at the same time the candidates are marshalled in, led by their guides. They advance between the lines of men who, hitherto silent, now break up into groups, each catching a lad and running madly up and down the village, followed by the women, waving spears and all uttering cries and yells and rubbing the youngsters' arms, legs, and bodies. They now make a wild rush towards the scaffolding, throwing the lads on it, who endeavour to climb up out of reach, but are torn back by the mob and undergo further agony, until, utterly exhausted with fright and fatigue, they are allowed to climb away. Still retaining their group formation, the men rush forward to the scaffold uttering horrible yells, waving their heads sideways with faces upturned to the lads, and swinging their clubs, only to retreat again. This violence and pandemonium continue through the night. At daybreak the girl candidates are led in and subjected to the same treatment in somewhat milder form. Then the candidates, male and female, are mustered on the ohu platform, where they sit completely covered with hoods of bark-cloth.

Guest are given betel-nut and sit in an arc. Possibly a special platform or house, a sort of bandstand, has been erected for the occasion. This is called ba oro,   i.e. ‘Taro men's house’, and is meant for the somewhat exclusive use of the accredited Taro men during the day, and for the chorus which is to continue throughout the night. The singers will crowd about a fire in the centre of the floor. The drums beat the distinctive Taro rhythm, viz. two equal beats followed by a pause equivalent to one of them, or time of three with the third beat missed. This rhythm, I believe, is used throughout the whole Division by the Taro singers, and, as far as I know, exclusively. It is the same rhythm as that of the dance baruga,   practised long previous to the advent of Taro, save that it is considerably slower. Some sects perform a stationary and others a sort of processional dance. Some participants show signs of possession. They report that the sensations are felt in the stomach, the legs, and the head. A man made a stirring motion with his forefinger to give some idea of the revolving in his stomach, called peri peri. The real or supposed affection of the lower limbs is sufficiently evidenced by the lurching and reeling in which the Taro man so commonly indulges. Some men hear a strong buzzing in their ears so loud and distracting that they want to shout out. Others say that during the jipari they cannot see properly.' <sup id="cite_ref-382" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-382">[382]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ taro medicine ritual ♥</b> 'A scene witnessed in the Aiga country is in many ways typical of the Taro cult, and in it we may see the medicine man at one of his characteristic tasks. A number of guests have assembled in the village of Totemaburari. The night and much of the forenoon have been spent in singing Taro songs, but still the revellers, whose endurance is greater than the jazzer's, show no signs of exhaustion. The principal Taro man, named Home, has been of late visited by his deceased father and has awoken to find a fresh supply of medicines in his hand. He now carries, strung together, a number of tiny packets, each neatly done up in a wrapping of green leaf, and each a very sizable mouthful. Upon close examination the packet proves to contain a somewhat repulsive hotchpotch, or rather salad, of five taro medicines, which have been already chewed with betel, spat out, and wrapped in the tidy, fair-seeming, little parcels to await a second chewing. At about noon Home, supported by two assistants who are like himself qualified Taro men, and attended by some twenty boisterous youths, sallies forth to perform the business of the day. This is nothing less than a wholesale medical treatment of the taro. Pushing rapidly through the garden, Home is seen to stoop and spray the medicines from his mouth over the taro leaves. He is continually tearing the husks from betel-nuts, which are necessary both to keep up his spirits and to ensure a suitably liquid medium for the ba sivo,   and continually plies himself with the little green packets which contain the ba sivo   itself. Here and there he pauses to break off some of the larger leaves (for the taros are well advanced and almost shoulder high). His two associates are similarly engaged, and meanwhile the chorus of young men, armed with their drums, are following or crowding around. The progress of the party is rapid and almost reckless: in reality the ceremony must conduce rather to the destruction than the growth of the taro, for the young drummers care little where they trample. The heat of the overhead sun is beyond endurance. The thirsty young men tear down bunches of sugar-cane and pounce upon the water-melons, regardless of their owners. One vociferous old woman stands in valiant defence of her melons, and a number of girls run on ahead to pluck their betel-pepper before the all-devouring chorus has reached it. But there is no lack of goodwill and merriment, and when, after almost two hours of this exceedingly strenuous employment, the Taro men return to the village, it is to partake of the feast which concludes almost every native ceremony.' <sup id="cite_ref-424" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-424">[424]</a></sup></dd>

<dl><dd><b>♠ Name ♣ Embahi separation ceremony ♥</b> 'Initiates are brought from the bush into the village. Having entered the village, they form two advancing lines until a large scaffolding is reached, erected at one end of the village. Turning, the men kneel down facing the entrance from which they have come and remain in this position, still keeping silence. It is at this stage that the candidates are presented. Faint cries arise from the bush, becoming louder and louder, and the words “Shi! Shi!” mingled with yells and shrieks are distinguished, and at the same time the candidates are marshalled in, led by their guides. They advance between the lines of men who, hitherto silent, now break up into groups, each catching a lad and running madly up and down the village, followed by the women, waving spears and all uttering cries and yells and rubbing the youngsters' arms, legs, and bodies. They now make a wild rush towards the scaffolding, throwing the lads on it, who endeavour to climb up out of reach, but are torn back by the mob and undergo further agony, until, utterly exhausted with fright and fatigue, they are allowed to climb away. Still retaining their group formation, the men rush forward to the scaffold uttering horrible yells, waving their heads sideways with faces upturned to the lads, and swinging their clubs, only to retreat again. This violence and pandemonium continue through the night. At daybreak the girl candidates are led in and subjected to the same treatment in somewhat milder form. Then the candidates, male and female, are mustered on the ohu platform, where they sit completely covered with hoods of bark-cloth.

</p><p>Note: Initially, political authority was confined to the informal leadership of elders and local big men: 'Political organization incorporates no central authority or hereditary leadership. Instead, it is characterized by big-men(EMBO DAMBO) and an ascendancy of elders who have proved themselves equal to the task. Such men command the respect of the village, based upon observed qualities of generosity, diligence, wealth, ability to make wise decisions, and skill in arranging ceremonial activities. This status confers no sanctioning authority, however. The Orokaiva tribes, around twelve in number, are very loose units politically and recognize no single leader. The largest unit is the tribe, which has a common territory usually demarcated from neighboring tribal territories by a belt of uninhabited land.' <sup id="cite_ref-506" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-506">[506]</a></sup> The labour and support of wives and younger men was key in the career of big men: 'Without multiple wives or a pool of single men retainers, the scope for a leader in large-scale exchange is limited. The lack of retainers attaching themselves to leaders' households could perhaps be due to the end of warfare and to improved community health so that there are now few orphans or fatherless sons. Almost every youth has a father or older brother to guarantee the payment of his brideprice. The productive relations between old men and young men are interesting in that they provide the possibility for a form of exploitation or unequal return for equal work, with the old men withholding the young men's access to a bride.' <sup id="cite_ref-507" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-507">[507]</a></sup> 'The social system is characterized by flexibility in arrangements for group membership and for transmission of rights to land. A village normally contains more than one clan branch and consequently is not necessarily a landholding unit. Residents may have closer kinship ties to residents of other villages than with some of their coresidents. Nevertheless, common residence implies some community of interest and a degree of group solidarity that is reinforced by government policy, which recognizes villages rather than descent groups as functional entities. Marriages between members of different clan branches within the village also reinforce this solidarity, which is expressed in ways such as daily food gifts, cooperation in certain tasks, and joint ceremonial activities. On the average, a lineage comprises three households. Usually, several clans are represented in a village, with members of a single clan (clan branches) being scattered among a number of neighboring villages. Lineages are more localized in cha racter, frequently being confined to a single village and tending to occupy one section of it.' <sup id="cite_ref-508" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-508">[508]</a></sup> 'There were ordinarily no persons who could command the allegiance of the tribe as a whole, nor was there any status with authority to effect the settlement of disputes between different subgroups or their individual members. Sometimes persistent intratribal conflicts led to short-term migration or to a splinter-group's secession from the tribe. However, these disturbances were very minor in comparison with the ‘flight, dispersal and migration’ in general resulting from incessant intertribal  feuds (see p. 35).' <sup id="cite_ref-509" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-509">[509]</a></sup> According to Williams, village and clan clusters occasionally formed ad hoc alliances when facing external threats: 'Williams ascribes the formation of ‘somewhat loose’ and temporary ‘confederacies of clans’, which conducted raids upon the tribe's kitoho, to a local spirit. But it is not clear whether by this he means the identification of members of a tribe with one territory or the unity of the ‘locality group’ which usually takes in a number of ‘clan-village units’ (see p.34) and which he describes as a more restricted ‘sympathy-group’ than the tribe (1930:107, 157, 163, 309-12). When he states (1925:407) that ‘over and above clan patriarchs there are recognised leaders of small clan confederacies and even - in war-time - of tribes’, he seems to equate the tribe with the district among the mountain Orokaiva (in particular Wasida and Isivita; see W.23, 124).' <sup id="cite_ref-510" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-510">[510]</a></sup> 'This combination for better defence may have been characteristic of tribes throughout the Orokaiva area. We believe, however, that the subdividing of the tribe into discrete named groups of named villages (either district or ‘hamlet group’) would be unique to the mountain Orokaiva in the culture area; we do not have enough evidence to show if this feature is related to the earlier clustering for safety, and to the greater population density in this tribe.' <sup id="cite_ref-511" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-511">[511]</a></sup> During the colonial period, British and Australian authorities superimposed their own administrative structure on the native system, installing village constables as intermediaries: 'In response to Australian pressure, the British government annexed Papua in 1888. Gold was discovered shortly thereafter, resulting in a major movement of prospectors and miners to what was then the Northern District. Relations with the Papuans were bad from the start, and there were numerous killings on both sides. The Protectorate of British New Guinea became Australian territory by the passing of the Papua Act of 1905 by the Commonwealth Government of Australia. The new administration adopted a policy of peaceful penetration, and many measures of social and economic national development were introduced. Local control was in the hands of village constables, paid servants of the Crown. Chosen by European officers, they were intermediaries between the government and the people. In 1951 an eruption occurred on Mount Lamington, completely devastating a large part of the area occupied by the Orokaiva.' <sup id="cite_ref-512" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-512">[512]</a></sup> Accordingly, some of the below variables might not apply to the Orokaiva.

<dl><dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from military ♣ present ♥</b> The Orokaiva did not employ professional military officers in interclan warfare, relying on residential and kin ties as well as informal leadership: 'In interclan warfare, the Binandere organised a division of fighting labour. The first group, the scouts, were sent ahead to kill the scouts of the enemy's main body. Then there were the front-line fighters, experienced men armed with clubs/spears and shields, forming the vanguard. Then there was a group of young people and men who had not killed. They beat drums, blew conch shells, sang war songs and generally used sound to frighten the enemy. Full-scale tribal warfare required the addition of two more groups. Firstly, sorcerers were carried on roofed litters from which they attempted to ward off enemy spirits. Being ritually pure they could have no contact with water. They ate only baked taro or bananas with coconut juice as well as much ginger. The second additional group were the strategists who were vital for long-drawn-out battles. This small group planned tactics, directed the front line and organised ambush killings and so on (1972:13-25).' <sup id="cite_ref-513" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-513">[513]</a></sup> 'Kinship and local affiliation together were the basic principles by which subgroups of the raiding party seem to have been drawn up during attack and on which leaders  within the party based their rights to command specific combatants.' <sup id="cite_ref-514" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-514">[514]</a></sup> 'Waiko (1972) describes in detail the warfare of the Binandere, a society which like the ancient Spartans was reputed to practise infanticide on weak or deformed sons (Monckton 1922:130). Training for warfare began at an early age for boys. At about 12 years old they began living together in a men's house and learning to dodge spears and to hold shields. Eventually they were required to prove themselves by killing a person in a raid (Waiko 1972:21). Part of the education imparted to the youths in the house was their primary duty to take revenge for the death of a clan member. A clan victim represented the clan and failure to avenge his death badly weakened their prestige and status. Killings had up to two generations delayed payback (1972:24-5).' <sup id="cite_ref-515" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-515">[515]</a></sup> During the colonial period, the Royal Papuan Constabulary was formed. [The constabulary was not Orokaiva specifically but Orokaiva men were drawn into the Royal Papuan Constabulary, where they often served alongside men from elsewhere in the Territory. There they received training from colonial authorities.] 'Thus, in the initial contact period, there were two major influences on the Orokaivan social order. First, the narrow moral universe of pre-contact days was widened. Orokaivans united in attempts to repulse the European intruders and also began to modify their traditional magic to improve taro. New spiritual rationale and ritual for these taro cults quickly spread through the Division after pacification.  Some Orokaivans united with Europeans as armed constabulary or as friends and defenders of the missionaries.' <sup id="cite_ref-516" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-516">[516]</a></sup> The development of the constabulary can be sketched as follows: 'During the first phase, no legislation allowed for a police force in either possession, a situation that ended in Papua in 1890 and in New Guinea in 1896. The second phase, which lasted until 1910, saw the establishment of police forces and was characterized by haphazard training and punitive expeditions. In the third phase, from 1910 to 1940, the police forces were consolidated and a coordinated and systematic training program was inaugurated. The disruption and trauma of World War II characterized the fourth phase, from 1940 to 1946. The fifth phase, which began after the war and continued into the 1960s, was marked by changes in structure and organization to accommodate changing conditions.' <sup id="cite_ref-517" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-517">[517]</a></sup> 'In New Guinea in 1888, the New Guinea Company took over the responsibility for the formation of a “peace keeping” force for the maintenance of law and order wherever the Germans had established jurisdiction. [...] However, very few Papuans and New Guineans were included in the early forces, which were composed mainly of foreigners: Australians, British, Germans, Malays, and South Sea Islanders (Dutton 1987, 62-63; Sinclair 1972, 918).' <sup id="cite_ref-518" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-518">[518]</a></sup> Training was initially on an ad hoc basis, but became more formalized later on: 'In Papua the annual reports for the period between 1890 and 1910 indicated that the training of new recruits was at best haphazard and at worst nonexistent. [...] In my assessment, the third phase, from 1911 of 1940 was the most significant. It not only marked the beginning of a coordinated and systematic police training program, but also set a pattern that continued to be influential after the war.' <sup id="cite_ref-519" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-519">[519]</a></sup> 'The fourth phase, 1940 to 1946, spanned the dramatic era of World War II. Because of the exigencies of the situation, policemen of both forces underwent short but intensive military training in Port Moresby before being deployed wherever they were most needed. The nature of the training received has no parallel in pre- or postwar forces of either territory.' <sup id="cite_ref-520" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-520">[520]</a></sup> Drill-sergeants (aka their equivalents among the colonial forces) worked from a training manual adopted in 1911 that was 'historically linked to British armies and the Royal Irish Constabulary. It proved attractive initially to the Papuan force, and later to the combined force' <sup id="cite_ref-521" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-521">[521]</a></sup> Training involved mostly military-style drills, giving the Constabulary a para-military character. In the 1930s, some elementary-level schooling was added: 'During the 1930s young men in Rabaul learned simple arithmetic, simple English, to tell the time of day by observing changes in the daily routine, and, for those selected for the police band, to read music. During 1933-1934, recruits with particular technical skills were accepted for the first time.' <sup id="cite_ref-522" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-522">[522]</a></sup>  A clear-cut distinction between law enforcement and military is hard to draw in this context. In World War II, Orokaiva men were drafted into the Australian colonial army: 'The war of 1939-1945 affected the Yega in several important ways. Their territory became one of the major battlefields of the Pacific War. Every person migrated from the area with the exception of one old crippled woman who somehow managed to survive for eighteen months in the bush. Almost all able-bodied men served in the army or labour corps and the women and children lived at another Anglican mission about thirty miles to the north. When they returned, they found all buildings, and any belongings that they had left behind, destroyed and most of their coconut palms cut down or damaged by gunfire. There were some compensations. The Australian Government paid thousands of dollars in war-damage compensation for all trees and property but, more important, the stimulus of travel, and meeting and working with Australian and American soldiers, gave the younger men in particular a broader view of life which triggered off changes in their traditional economy. In addition, the transfer of the Administrative headquarters from Buna to Higaturu resulted in the construction of a major road to the port of Cape Killerton and brought the Yega into closer touch with the outside world than ever before. As a result, between 1945 and 1950, about twenty families left their re-built villages and moved east to found the new village of Surilai at Cape Killerton (Fig. 9).' <sup id="cite_ref-523" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-523">[523]</a></sup> Orokaiva men also worked as carriers, although their loyalties as a group were at times ambiguous: 'Those in the Northern Division saw the Japanese invasion, bloody fighting and occupation by Allied forces. This led to the peculiar position where the Orokaivans were seen as ‘fuzzy wuzzy angels’ as well as traitors and murderers. ‘Fuzzy wuzzy angel’  was a nickname given to conscripted carriers who demonstrated remarkable solicitude for the wounded whom they carried during the battle on the Kokoda Trail, and who showed considerable endurance in carrying both men and supplies for the Allies over the four months from July until October 1942. The Japanese presence in Northern Division did, however, lead to a reassessment of loyalties on the part of the Orokaivans and the consequent betrayal of some Allied personnel.' <sup id="cite_ref-524" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-524">[524]</a></sup> Orokaivas were conscripted into many non-combat roles as well: 'During the heavy fighting, most villagers had fled to garden houses where they could hide safely. However, in June 1942, there was an order made that ‘any native might be conscripted to serve anywhere in the Territories or Papua or New Guinea, more or less on any conditions imposed by the District Officers’.  Carriers had worked so well during the Kokoda campaign that officials of the Australian New Guinea Army Unit (ANGAU) were keen to recruit more (Army File 285/1/680A; Benson 1957:18; Ryan 1969). Those men who were able to avoid the physical confrontations of the war by hiding in rough garden shelters for the duration could not avoid the consequences of the war. They became subject to conscription for work on plantations, for carrying, for malaria control and for clearing and construction work until the war was over (Army File 5/3/147).' <sup id="cite_ref-525" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-525">[525]</a></sup> We need to take into account the presence of colonial armed forces and the recruitment of native men into armed bodies. The above seems to indicate that some separation of executive and military powers was present. This is open to review.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from legislative ♣ absent ♥</b> We have found no evidence of a separate legislative body.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Executive power is separate or independent from judiciary ♣ absent ♥</b> SCCS variable 149 'Writing and Records' is coded as ‘1’ or ‘None’, not ‘Mnemonic devices’, or ‘Nonwritten records’, or 'True writing, no records', or ‘True writing; records’. SCCS variable 89 'Judiciary' is coded as ‘1’ or 'absent'. Local law was informal: 'There is a word igege (Binandele yege) which may be translated ‘moral law’, or perhaps, since the examples are all negative, ‘moral prohibition’. The examples were such as the following: not to steal a man's vegetables, canoes, spears, &amp;c.; not to usurp his fishing rights; not to take his dog to hunt, but to drive it back if it followed the hunter of its own accord; not to commit adultery; not to beat one's wife overmuch; not to commit assault on another man. These igege were for adults; they did not apply to children, who had to be treated with so much indulgence; still less to dogs, whose nature it was to steal on sight. While not implying standardization, the mere existence of the word hints at a definite conception of right and wrong.' <sup id="cite_ref-526" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-526">[526]</a></sup> So was judicial procedure on the village level: 'For those who remain in the village, the sanctioning mechanisms are mostly informal. Failure in one's obligations means loss of status, leads to gossip, derogatory remarks to one's face, perhaps even a harangue at night by a man at the other end in the village. The councillor, the court and the police are only a last resort in serious quarrels. I saw a councillor enter a dispute once, playing a mediating role between disputants from two villages, but without playing more than an advisory role. One quarrel was taken to court, but this was not a case where traditional mechanisms of social control had failed. A woman accused her husband of adultery with one of the new Garombi arrivals. She and the husband fought and had to be separated as the lady had an axe; the domestic dispute soon died down but the Garombi woman laid a complaint for slander with the police. Before this came to court, the wife had been roundly condemned by almost everyone in the village; she had repented, had gone round the village to signify her regrets, and been as contrite as her pride could possibly allow her to be. The court let her off with a reprimand. The episode, far from suggesting a flagging of Orokaiva traditional social control, had demonstrated to me that it was still effective. Nonetheless, the Orokaiva, as so many other peoples in contact with Western civilisation, have been quick to see the advantages of a judicial system providing an impartial arbiter in disputes, to whose decisions both parties will defer. At the moment, this western judicial system is an additional resource of Orokaiva law, without undermining its existing institutions.' <sup id="cite_ref-527" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-527">[527]</a></sup> 'There is no judicial procedure among the Orokaiva, and no ‘police force’. In so far as sorcery is concerned, by the way, these deficiencies are perhaps not altogether deplorable. The suspicion of sorcery, where it is backed up by ignorant legal authority, may go to extraordinary lengths of oppression. No Papuan people has reached that stage of legal development which would have made possible such condemnations as those of West Africa' <sup id="cite_ref-528" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-528">[528]</a></sup> No native courts were present: 'It will be seen, from what I have said, that this book offers a many-sided attraction, but to an administrator the most interesting part is the last chapter. For in that chapter Mr. Williams deals with a phenomenon which has always appeared to me to be very difficult to understand, though it is common enough in Papua, and that is the well-ordered regulation of a peaceful society with apparently no government and no administration of justice to support it. There are no chiefs with any authority worth talking about among the Orokaiva, and the same is true of nearly the whole of Papua, and there are no Courts and no recognized method of enforcing native law or custom, and yet within the community, within what Mr. Williams calls the ‘sympathy group’, life is probably as peaceful and as orderly as it is with us. How this result can be obtained in the absence of any objective sanction is one of the puzzles of native administration.' <sup id="cite_ref-529" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-529">[529]</a></sup> The native Constabulary did not have judicial powers and mostly filled the role of law enforcement: 'Village Constables. The suppression by force which had marked the early contact phase gave way to a form of ‘indirect rule’ through the appointment of Village Constables. The earliest Village Constables were the strong, leading men who had confronted the Europeans as warriors. As time passed war leaders were no longer a feature of the society, but patrol reports indicate that by and large Village Constables were influential and effective in the maintenance of law and order. The position of Village Constables was an uncomfortable and interstitial one. They had the difficult task of attempting to juggle the interests of their relatives and exchange partners and of the Administration, so that both sides were reasonably happy most of the time. Between 1907 and 1914 the number of Village Constables in the Northern Division rose from fifty-four to eighty-three, indicating that this system of administration was satisfactory to the Australian authorities. The Village Constables were concerned with enforcing legislation which impinged upon many aspects of daily life: burial of the dead, upkeep of roads, construction of latrines, neatness of houses and so on. Failure to obey these regulations could lead to imprisonment.' <sup id="cite_ref-530" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-530">[530]</a></sup> The colonial authorities introduced legal codes: 'When the Papuan Act was passed in 1905 by the Australian Commonwealth Parliament, it provided a legal framework for the Australian Administration in the whole of the Territory, of which Northern Division was a part. Ordinances whose provisions had a particular relevance for Northern Division were those that imposed a tax and made cash cropping, carrying and roadbuilding compulsory.' <sup id="cite_ref-531" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-531">[531]</a></sup> The colonial authorities also established prisons: 'Part of the setting up of a governmental organization was the establishment of gaols and the punishment of villagers who infringed the laws and regulations. By 1903, 100 Orokaivans had been committed for trial on charges ranging from murder to breach of school regulations. Kokoda gaol alone had seventy-nine prisoners in 1905 and 168 in 1906. Speaking of one of the groups who inhabited Northern Division, Wetherell observes that this time they had ‘brushed with a tribe they could never conquer’' <sup id="cite_ref-532" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-532">[532]</a></sup> Colonial magistrates fulfilled both executive and judicial roles: 'Cases of imputed sorcery often come before the magistrate, but not a few of them, I believe, have to be dismissed as unproven. Some of these are deliberately trumped up, but many more are the outcome of mere groundless suspicion. It is probably true, moreover, that but a small proportion of the ‘cases’ are ever referred to the magistrate, for unless the evidence is very strong the native feels there is little hope of securing an indictment. Sorcery and magic, indeed, are often regarded as something a little beyond the ken of the matter-of-fact white man.' <sup id="cite_ref-533" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-533">[533]</a></sup> Courts were also of colonial origin: 'The term pure ari is appropriate to describe the white man's labour if for no other reason than that a ‘job’ just like the pure is a place where one spends the day. The new dispensation has, sure enough, its own conflict (isoro) and mode of conflict resolution. Councillor-Colin brings this out by his example of the policeman who puts village men into handcuffs and takes them off to court. In such a case it was the task of the sorcerer to ensure that the men would escape conviction and be set free again.' <sup id="cite_ref-534" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-534">[534]</a></sup>  Orokaiva villagers were thus subject to legal codes established by the colonial authorities and tried according to them while retaining informal procedures of dispute resolution on the local level. Given how magistrates combined judicial and executive functions, we have decided to code for 'absent'.</dd></dl>

The Protectorate of British New Guinea became Australian territory by the passing of the Papua Act of 1905 by the Commonwealth Government of Australia. The new administration adopted a policy of peaceful penetration, and many measures of social and economic national development were introduced. Local control was in the hands of village constables, paid servants of the Crown. Chosen by European officers, they were intermediaries between the government and the people. In 1951 an eruption occurred on Mount Lamington, completely devastating a large part of the area occupied by the Orokaiva.' <sup id="cite_ref-545" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-545">[545]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b>♠ Professionalization of local bureaucracy ♣ present ♥</b> [Constables received training from colonial authorities. As to local bureaucrats, it is not quite clear how extensively they were examined, in the early days. It may not have been a formal, standard examination with set questions but something more of an interview. This remains in need of further confirmation. The Papua Annual Reports, other reports by J.H.P. Murray (possibly a special reivew of the administration for the government in Canberra around 1920 or 1922) or his letters or biography by Francis West may provide more information on this. While there was some training, it was limited (i.e., mostly "on the job") until after WWII, when the Australian School of Pacific Adminsitration (ASOPA) was formed. An attempt that was made In the 1920s to start a formal training course in Sydney for administrative officers ("patrol officers", also called "kiaps") who were bound for Papua. How long the course continued remains in need of confirmation.] Training for constables was largely physical and based on military-style drills. Formal examination seems to have been rare for constables during this time period, although the process may have been more formalized for colonial officials: 'Some idea of the education level reached after the completion of the six months training at the depot in Papua is revealed by Corporal Garuwa’s examination paper (figure 4). Two lance-corporals vied for promotion to the rank of corporal in the Papuan Armed Constabulary in 1932. As both men had given meritorious service to the force, an examination was conducted to decide the one most eligible for the promotion. Corporal Garuwa made only one mistake and was promoted.' <sup id="cite_ref-546" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-546">[546]</a></sup> We have therefore assumed no standardized examination for native officials. Kituai's comments seem to confirm this: 'Records in the annual reports for both administrative centers for the period before World War II did not always summarize what constituted proper training for the police force, but they frequently provided statistics on recruitment and distribution after training.' <sup id="cite_ref-547" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-547">[547]</a></sup> But it still seems that native officials were 'professionals' in the sense of being formally employed by the colonial government. This is open to review.

<p><b>♠ Multiple legal systems ♣ present ♥</b> Orokaiva villagers were subject to legal codes established by the colonial authorities and tried according to them while retaining informal procedures of dispute resolution on the local level.

SCCS variable 89 'Judiciary' is coded as ‘1’ or 'absent'. Local law was informal: 'There is a word igege (Binandele yege) which may be translated ‘moral law’, or perhaps, since the examples are all negative, ‘moral prohibition’. The examples were such as the following: not to steal a man's vegetables, canoes, spears, &amp;c.; not to usurp his fishing rights; not to take his dog to hunt, but to drive it back if it followed the hunter of its own accord; not to commit adultery; not to beat one's wife overmuch; not to commit assault on another man. These igege were for adults; they did not apply to children, who had to be treated with so much indulgence; still less to dogs, whose nature it was to steal on sight. While not implying standardization, the mere existence of the word hints at a definite conception of right and wrong.' <sup id="cite_ref-548" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-548">[548]</a></sup> So was judicial procedure on the village level: 'For those who remain in the village, the sanctioning mechanisms are mostly informal. Failure in one's obligations means loss of status, leads to gossip, derogatory remarks to one's face, perhaps even a harangue at night by a man at the other end in the village. The councillor, the court and the police are only a last resort in serious quarrels. I saw a councillor enter a dispute once, playing a mediating role between disputants from two villages, but without playing more than an advisory role. One quarrel was taken to court, but this was not a case where traditional mechanisms of social control had failed. A woman accused her husband of adultery with one of the new Garombi arrivals. She and the husband fought and had to be separated as the lady had an axe; the domestic dispute soon died down but the Garombi woman laid a complaint for slander with the police. Before this came to court, the wife had been roundly condemned by almost everyone in the village; she had repented, had gone round the village to signify her regrets, and been as contrite as her pride could possibly allow her to be. The court let her off with a reprimand. The episode, far from suggesting a flagging of Orokaiva traditional social control, had demonstrated to me that it was still effective. Nonetheless, the Orokaiva, as so many other peoples in contact with Western civilisation, have been quick to see the advantages of a judicial system providing an impartial arbiter in disputes, to whose decisions both parties will defer.

Each clan is subdivided into named subgroups or lineages that trace their origin to a named ancestor.' <sup id="cite_ref-575" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-575">[575]</a></sup> 'Kinship terminology is of the Iroquois type.' <sup id="cite_ref-576" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-576">[576]</a></sup> Clans and lineages held and transmitted lands, but individuals owned and distributed garden plots within lineage territory: 'Inheritance is usually patrilineal.' <sup id="cite_ref-577" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-577">[577]</a></sup> 'Various land rights may be given to the clan branch, the lineage, or an individual, the relative significance of each varying with the locality and population density. More than one descent group may have rights in a single piece of land. In many instances, the clan branch functions as a reference group, with all land being associated with it. However, it may also function as a primary right-holding group for those hunting areas distinct from current garden land, typically the grasslands. Primary rights to garden land are normally vested in the lineage. Nevertheless, all such land is ultimately identifiable with individuals who may distribute land (and property) prior to their death not only to their immediate family but also to more distant kin. Traditional tree crops are not planted in stands or groups like cash-crop trees but are widely scattered and are as likely to be planted on patrimonial land as on the land of affines or matrilateral kin. Inheritance of rights to trees usually does not bring rights to the land on which they stand.' <sup id="cite_ref-578" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-578">[578]</a></sup> Williams provides a general description of the property system: 'Before we can fully understand the system of using the land, it is necessary to describe the system under which it is owned. Among the Orokaiva there is a multiplicity of small clans, which from time to time increases by subdivision (a process which is in part neutralized by the dying out of older clans). Now the land is owned in reality by the clan. The fact that very commonly the clan is a local unity, being often coincident with the single village, makes this system a simple one in the normal instance. Sometimes, however, the clan is somewhat [Page 125] scattered, occupying several villages or parts of several villages. In this case the clan will in all probability retain a nominal ownership of all its lands; but in practice it is customary for the various sections to assume by general consent or else by the allocation of a headman, the occupation and usage of particular parts of the land. In due time the section is likely to adopt a distinctive name, and to develop into an independent clan: the right of usage tacitly becomes ownership, and we find the normal condition restored, viz. the clan locally unified and in possession of its own tracts of land. A system exactly similar governs the ownership of the small waterways (useful for fishing) and of the sago swamps.' <sup id="cite_ref-579" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-579">[579]</a></sup> 'The Orokaiva clan is virtually a patriarchal group; there is no real chieftainship, but a recognized ascendancy of the old man, provided his vigour of mind and body is equal to his position. As it begins to fail his place is gradually occupied by a younger man. Only in the larger clans, where there are well-defined family groups, does the question of hereditary succession appear, and then it is a somewhat faint appearance.' <sup id="cite_ref-580" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-580">[580]</a></sup> 'It is sometimes said that the chief owns the land, though this is hardly more than a form of speech. He does something, however, towards administering it. For instance, he can say which area is to be laid under cultivation at any time, and he can subdivide and allot the territory of the clan among its branches. He feels himself and is felt to be the guardian of the land. Thus we hear an old man telling how his father had given him death-bed injunctions-‘Friday he talk, Saturday he die,’ as the interpreter put it in order to make clear the testamentary nature of the charge-to allow all his own people to make their gardens on the clan's territory, but to suffer no strangers.' <sup id="cite_ref-581" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-581">[581]</a></sup> 'Among the members of the clan there is a very considerable amount of personal freedom, and, except in so far as there may be an allocation of land and fishing rights between branches or families, they may in theory make their gardens where they please. There is occasional [Page 126] wrangling as to garden boundaries, but these petty disagreements within the clan, so to speak, are as a rule easily settled. The land disputes which bring endless trouble and labour to the magistrate are disputes between clans. While the land is owned communally the garden is owned individually. Between two adjacent gardens the boundary is made of felled trees, laid end to end, sometimes in two rows so as to form a path between. So long as this ground is under cultivation, not only the produce of the garden but the garden itself is individual property, and a displacement of the boundary would mean a quarrel.' <sup id="cite_ref-582" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-582">[582]</a></sup> Williams describes the allocation of garden plots: 'I may now describe the system by which the land is used: it may be called a Rotation of Areas. Each clan will possess a number of tracts of land, which bear locality names. These may or may not be contiguous. Often, owing to migratory habits or to the reclamation of some distant and hitherto unoccupied block of land, they may be somewhat scattered.' <sup id="cite_ref-583" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-583">[583]</a></sup> 'When the gardener finds himself clearing once more on the familiar ground which was used perhaps many years before, he does not necessarily plant on the precise spot which was his previously. There is, as a rule, so much ground to spare that he is welcome to begin where he pleases, and without the risk of offending a fellow clansman. It does sometimes happen, however, that a man acquires a sort of prescriptive right to the immediate [Page 129] locality where he has worked, and accordingly we sometimes find an easy-going division of an area between families or branches of the clan. No doubt this becomes a stricter division where the available land is circumscribed; for individual ownership of land probably has its origin in scarcity of land.' <sup id="cite_ref-584" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-584">[584]</a></sup> The interests of clans and families could be at odds with each other: 'It is only necessary to stress the point that the immediate family is recognized as a social unit; and the mere fact that a man sometimes quarrels with the members of his clan and migrates with his family or settles somewhere apart, proves that the family interest may compete with that of the clan. Both units are co-operative, the family especially in respect of the food quest, the clan in respect of ceremonies and feasts, and more importantly of fighting. The clan owns the garden land, but the family cultivates its own patch and reaps its own harvest. On the whole, since the clan displays a constant tendency to split into smaller groups of which the family is the nucleus, it is difficult to draw a line between the two.

<dd><b>♠ Lease ♣ present ♥</b> The colonial authorities leased some land to European settlers: 'Roads, taxes, carrying and compulsory cashcropping all tended to benefit the European population in the long run, though some benefits for Papuans were also envisaged. A system of 99-year leases was introduced by the Australians in 1906, but land alienation was restricted in an effort to protect Papuans. Land bought from the Orokaivans or claimed as waste and vacant was leased to Europeans on condition that they made improvements. On such land several plantations were established in Northern Division.' <sup id="cite_ref-593" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-593">[593]</a></sup> Schwimmer's comments seem to imply that some kind of lease arrangement was present among the native population as well: 'The same remark may be made in respect of labour assistance between households which is normally given without payments except for a meal at the end of the day. If, however, the service is given in connection with work for which the person assisted will eventually get paid, then the service falls within a different category and must be paid for. The same rule applies to the granting of land useholds for which no rent is ever demanded if the land produces (only) use values, but the situation changes when it produces exchange values.

The enda ta titi jigari embo is the man who ‘holds his eye on the land’ or looks after it. Williams saw him as a guardian administering the land, subdividing and allocating the territory among the clan branches. Although there is no ‘real chieftainship’ in large clans, ‘hereditary succession [had a] faint appearance’ (1928:125).' <sup id="cite_ref-599" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-599">[599]</a></sup> 'In Koropata 2 the position is usually passed from father to eldest son. If the early death of a leader leaves an immature son, then a younger brother of the dead man may intervene and take control. If an heir to clan land leadership has been absent for a long time from the village, a distantly related but enterprising claimant may take over the title and authority.' <sup id="cite_ref-600" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-600">[600]</a></sup> Ceremonial ornaments were also inherited patrilineally: 'Traditional valuables. The possession of hambo (bone and shell ornaments) and di (feather headdress) may give some indication of a man's adherence to traditional values. In traditional Orokaiva society the possession of such valuables demonstrated wealth and prowess, but this function is now being taken over by money, as the relative importance of cash as the means of procuring desirable products increases, and money transactions become more frequent. Hambo and di are inherited through the father and sometimes other relatives, and they are usually distributed among the surviving sons. It is difficult to assess the traditional valuables owned by any one individual, as a man often looks after his younger brothers' shares and more than one person, both within and without the nuclear family, may have rights to the hambo and di kept in a particular household.' <sup id="cite_ref-601" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-601">[601]</a></sup> But non-patrilineal transfers of property, including land, were also practiced: 'We may, first of all, divide these transfers into two broad types: those occurring within corporate groups, and those occurring outside them. In a strict unilineal system, it would be possible to draw a land map showing areas owned by a lineage, and if the system were segmentary, one might speak of a clan domain, a tribal domain and so forth. Such boundaries would theoretically remain unchanged in perpetuity as each generation inherited holdings in the patriline or matriline. No New Guinea system of which we have a recent professional description approximates even remotely to such a model, at least in practice, as we find that many land holdings in so-called patrilineal groups pass into the hands of uterine kin and affines. Among the Orokaiva the departures [Page 96] from a patrilineal norm are so frequent that it is unusual for any man to hold precisely the same blocks as his father who was enda mama before him. Nor do clan boundaries and village boundaries remain unchanged for any length of time. In themselves, such departures from patrilineal ideology do not in the least reduce the usefulness of a descent model for the explanation of Orokaiva land tenure, providing that we can plausibly regard all departures from the patrilineal rule as random responses to the vicissitudes of life. In the past, some New Guinea ethnographers have proceeded from this assumption, whereas others (e.g. Lawrence 1967) were willing to recognise structural regularities in the transfer of land to persons other than agnates: The potential social relationships which can be deduced from titles to land are of great theoretical importance. They represent an interlocking system of rights and obligations which can reinforce purely biological relationships (those of kinship and descent) within the security circle. (Lawrence 1967:114).' <sup id="cite_ref-602" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-602">[602]</a></sup> While fathers were expected to transmit some land to their sons, their were free to transmit the remaining property to other relatives: 'The first question that needs to be resolved, in the case of the Orokaiva, is whether there is really a rule enjoining a man to leave his land to his sons (if he has any). I found the rule to be much more ambiguous. If a man has sons, he is expected to leave them at least half his land, but he is free to dispose of the other half to others - sisters, daughters, adopted children, for example. Thus a degree of freedom of disposition is built into the Orokaiva system. The many cases of non-patrilineal inheritance quoted by Rimoldi, and others I could add, are therefore not exceptions to a rule but the operation of a rule clearly stated by informants. In this discussion, I shall first show on a purely empirical basis that some land transfers are explained by a principle of descent and others on the principle of what Lawrence calls reinforcement of relationships within the security circle. Next, I shall investigate how far the transactional model developed above can provide a principle of higher generality which will sufficiently explain all land transfers, patrilineal and other. In the present section I shall concentrate on transfers within the patrilineage.' <sup id="cite_ref-603" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-603">[603]</a></sup> Usufruct rights in trees and their fruit were transmitted from father to son, but trees were also planted for sister's children: 'Most villagers had lived in several villages, some of which are now abandoned, and had planted coconuts there which they still claim. They usually had similar numbers scattered over parcels of land where they had gardened in the past. Sixty-two per cent of all trees had been planted on the patrimonial land of the person claiming the trees. A man often plants trees while gardening on the land of affines or matrilateral kin and these trees are inherited by the planter's son.' <sup id="cite_ref-604" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-604">[604]</a></sup> 'It is customary for a man to plant a few trees on his own land for his sister's children for their later use. Women sometimes acquire trees of their own in this way but unless a woman is the sole surviving member of the agnatic group in which are vested the rights to the land carrying economic trees which she uses, she acquires no rights to specific trees from her father. After marriage she has only limited access to her patrikin's trees whose produce she previously shared. One householder stated that he would not expect his sister to ask for produce from his trees because her husband should have enough of his own. Another once lodged a formal complaint with the Department of District Administration staff against his sister's husband who had come from another village to harvest one of his trees without first seeking his permission.' <sup id="cite_ref-605" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-605">[605]</a></sup> Accordingly, there was a tension between patrilineal ideology and more ambiguous practice: 'We notice, however, an apparent conflict between patrilineal ideology and practice. According to the ideology, an Orokaiva patrimony is passed on from an enda mama to his successor; there is no rule for splitting up the patrimony between the sons of a deceased enda mama. How does it come about, then, that every extended family has its own enda mama? The process is easy to describe. It is customary for an enda mama to allocate land to all married men of his extended family on a more or less permanent basis. He has the right to change these allocations when special circumstances arise but changes do not occur often. As the enda mama becomes older, and less able to make his own gardens, he tends to distribute more and more plots, either to his sons or to other persons of his choice. Though the patrimony remains undivided in theory, in practice it is being divided. In this subdivision, the rights of brothers are supposed to be equal regardless of seniority.' <sup id="cite_ref-606" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-606">[606]</a></sup> Schwimmer therefore speaks of variable and flexible extended families rather than stable lineages: 'In summary, the religious, political and economic attributes of the extended family enable us to describe it undoubtedly as a corporate group. It has to be recognised, however, that the parcels of land controlled by this corporation vary considerably from generation to generation. A corporation will shed parcels which are permanently vested in other lineages, and will obtain new parcels from uterine kin and others. Plant (n.d.), Belshaw (1951), Crocombe and Hogbin (1963) have all treated this land corporation as comprising a ‘lineage’, so that it may seem idiosyncratic that I am calling it an ‘extended family’. My reason for changing the description is that I was unable to find any case of an extended family lacking an enda mama. There are, of course, lineages comprising more than one extended family, but in such cases one finds more than one enda mama. Crocombe and Hogbin, faced with this phenomenon, added the term ‘sub-lineage’ to their pyramid of segmentary patrilineal groupings, but their small sample contains no case of a ‘sub-lineage’ comprising more than one extended family. In these circumstances we may well delay discussion of the range of control of the enda mama until we examine patrilineal ideology in Chapter X.' <sup id="cite_ref-607" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-607">[607]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Use of property ♣ present ♥</b> The colonial authorities imposed increased arboriculture on indigenous groups for commercial purposes: 'Arboriculture. Although the Orokaiva traditionally planted coconut, betelnut and a few other trees in gardens, villages and in the bush, their arboriculture used to be rudimentary in comparison to their precise and detailed attention to tubers, especially taro. The Australian authorities had hardly established themselves in Papua before they began to press the population into extensive arboriculture that would yield a cash income. One of the early ‘native regulations’ (No. 121, passed in 1903), compelled all Papuan villages to grow a stipulated number of rubber trees. Three such rubber stands were established at Sivepe, ranging from one half to three acres in area, all village men supposedly sharing in the work. Rimoldi (1966: 86-93), who describes in detail the vicissitudes of exploitation of these trees, shows how ill-adapted communal rubber stands are to a society lacking institutions for the distribution of corporate assets to its members. Nonetheless, a further stand was established, this time quite voluntarily, in 1964. They are known as the ‘company trees’, have not yielded any cash, and will be discussed in detail below as the land transactions involved cast light on the ideology of contemporary Orokaiva co-operative movements.' <sup id="cite_ref-608" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-608">[608]</a></sup> Coffee plantations were introduced in a similar manner in the mid-century period: '‘Communal’ village plantations for coffee were established in the Northern District under the same regulations as applied to rubber, but all producing trees in the villages I visited had been grown on quasi-individual holdings. First plantings were around 1955. On a rough estimate I would say that the number of trees in Sivepe and Hohorita, two villages on the foothills, were 3,500 and 15,000, while Inonda, on alluvial plains, had 800. Coffee is one crop that [Page 23] actually has provided the Orokaiva with a reliable and substantial cash income for some years. This is true to a very minor extent for the third cash crop promoted on a major scale, copra, which was grown especially near the coast. The coffee is processed and sent to a co-operative factory as parchment, for which purpose many villages own one or more hullers. Copra is supposed to be dried in driers built in the villages, but the one I saw in Inonda had broken down and seems unlikely to be repaired.' <sup id="cite_ref-609" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-609">[609]</a></sup> Cash-cropping was made compulsory in the early 20th century: 'When the Papuan Act was passed in 1905 by the Australian Commonwealth Parliament, it provided a legal framework for the Australian Administration in the whole of the Territory, of which Northern Division was a part. Ordinances whose provisions had a particular relevance for Northern Division were those that imposed a tax and made cash cropping, carrying and roadbuilding compulsory.' <sup id="cite_ref-610" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-610">[610]</a></sup> 'In spite of lobbying from Europeans, a tax on the indigenous population was not imposed until 1918 when a £2 head tax per annum on adult males was instituted (Griffin et al. 1979:23; Wolfers 1975:34, 37; PAR 1894:v, vii, viii).' <sup id="cite_ref-611" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-611">[611]</a></sup> 'Cash cropping. The initial ordinance requiring villages to plant coconuts was passed in 1894, the intention being that the cash income would benefit the villages. Despite the fact that the planting of the communal stands was difficult to enforce and that the copra brought little cash return, by 1914 there were 10,000 planted palms in the Buna area. In 1918 the Native Plantation Ordinance set out more clearly new mechanisms of operation. In accordance with this, in 1921 the Crown started buying land for Native Plantations. Able-bodied men within 5 miles were required to work 60 days a year in lieu of tax. Failure to do so meant that they had to pay tax and, in addition, risk a fine or imprisonment. It was originally envisaged that the produce from the plantation would be divided between villagers and government but, in practice, the produce was sold and the money divided between the villagers and the government. The government's share was to be spent on works benefiting the Papuans. This part of the scheme was never fully implemented. Villagers' returns from the copra sales remained very small and occasionally they expressed their anger at this. Coffee planted under the scheme gave better returns and, by 1939, the areas planted with this cash crop around Higaturu were producing 84 tons of hulled coffee a year.' <sup id="cite_ref-612" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-612">[612]</a></sup> 'In sum then, the mechanisms of pre-war colonialism included a compulsory tax, compulsory cashcropping, compulsory carrying and roadwork. Rewards consisted of tobacco, steel tools and cash, among other things. Results for village production were periods of enforced absence of men and, presumably, an increased efficiency in men's labour due to steel axes. Women's work continued without labour-saving devices and often without the help of the men.

</p><p><b>Inheritance System</b>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>♠ partible inheritance ♣ present ♥</b> Some titles were not divisible in theory, but partible in practice: 'We notice, however, an apparent conflict between patrilineal ideology and practice. According to the ideology, an Orokaiva patrimony is passed on from an enda mama to his successor; there is no rule for splitting up the patrimony between the sons of a deceased enda mama. How does it come about, then, that every extended family has its own enda mama? The process is easy to describe. It is customary for an enda mama to allocate land to all married men of his extended family on a more or less permanent basis. He has the right to change these allocations when special circumstances arise but changes do not occur often. As the enda mama becomes older, and less able to make his own gardens, he tends to distribute more and more plots, either to his sons or to other persons of his choice. Though the patrimony remains undivided in theory, in practice it is being divided. In this subdivision, the rights of brothers are supposed to be equal regardless of seniority.' <sup id="cite_ref-621" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-621">[621]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ patrilineal inheritance ♣ present ♥</b> Orokaiva society was organized in patrilineal clans: 'Every Orokaiva is recruited by birth into the clan of his or her father. All members of a clan claim, but cannot necessarily trace, common descent from a usually eponymous ancestor. Each clan is subdivided into named subgroups or lineages that trace their origin to a named ancestor.' <sup id="cite_ref-622" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-622">[622]</a></sup> 'Kinship terminology is of the Iroquois type.' <sup id="cite_ref-623" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-623">[623]</a></sup> Clans and lineages held and transmitted land, but individuals also owned garden plots: 'Various land rights may be given to the clan branch, the lineage, or an individual, the relative significance of each varying with the locality and population density. More than one descent group may have rights in a single piece of land. In many instances, the clan branch functions as a reference group, with all land being associated with it. However, it may also function as a primary right-holding group for those hunting areas distinct from current garden land, typically the grasslands. Primary rights to garden land are normally vested in the lineage. Nevertheless, all such land is ultimately identifiable with individuals who may distribute land (and property) prior to their death not only to their immediate family but also to more distant kin. Traditional tree crops are not planted in stands or groups like cash-crop trees but are widely scattered and are as likely to be planted on patrimonial land as on the land of affines or matrilateral kin. Inheritance of rights to trees usually does not bring rights to the land on which they stand.' <sup id="cite_ref-624" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-624">[624]</a></sup> 'Inheritance is usually patrilineal.' <sup id="cite_ref-625" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-625">[625]</a></sup> There was an inherited office for the allocation of clan lands, typically also inherited patrilineally: 'As already mentioned, there is an inherited office related to the control of clan land at the clan level. The enda ta titi jigari embo is the man who ‘holds his eye on the land’ or looks after it. Williams saw him as a guardian administering the land, subdividing and allocating the territory among the clan branches. Although there is no ‘real chieftainship’ in large clans, ‘hereditary succession [had a] faint appearance’ (1928:125).' <sup id="cite_ref-626" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-626">[626]</a></sup> 'In Koropata 2 the position is usually passed from father to eldest son. If the early death of a leader leaves an immature son, then a younger brother of the dead man may intervene and take control. If an heir to clan land leadership has been absent for a long time from the village, a distantly related but enterprising claimant may take over the title and authority.' <sup id="cite_ref-627" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-627">[627]</a></sup> Ceremonial ornaments were also inherited patrilineally: 'Traditional valuables. The possession of hambo (bone and shell ornaments) and di (feather headdress) may give some indication of a man's adherence to traditional values. In traditional Orokaiva society the possession of such valuables demonstrated wealth and prowess, but this function is now being taken over by money, as the relative importance of cash as the means of procuring desirable products increases, and money transactions become more frequent. Hambo and di are inherited through the father and sometimes other relatives, and they are usually distributed among the surviving sons. It is difficult to assess the traditional valuables owned by any one individual, as a man often looks after his younger brothers' shares and more than one person, both within and without the nuclear family, may have rights to the hambo and di kept in a particular household.' <sup id="cite_ref-628" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-628">[628]</a></sup> But non-patrilineal transfers of property, including land, were also practiced: 'We may, first of all, divide these transfers into two broad types: those occurring within corporate groups, and those occurring outside them. In a strict unilineal system, it would be possible to draw a land map showing areas owned by a lineage, and if the system were segmentary, one might speak of a clan domain, a tribal domain and so forth. Such boundaries would theoretically remain unchanged in perpetuity as each generation inherited holdings in the patriline or matriline. No New Guinea system of which we have a recent professional description approximates even remotely to such a model, at least in practice, as we find that many land holdings in so-called patrilineal groups pass into the hands of uterine kin and affines. Among the Orokaiva the departures [Page 96] from a patrilineal norm are so frequent that it is unusual for any man to hold precisely the same blocks as his father who was enda mama before him. Nor do clan boundaries and village boundaries remain unchanged for any length of time. In themselves, such departures from patrilineal ideology do not in the least reduce the usefulness of a descent model for the explanation of Orokaiva land tenure, providing that we can plausibly regard all departures from the patrilineal rule as random responses to the vicissitudes of life. In the past, some New Guinea ethnographers have proceeded from this assumption, whereas others (e.g. Lawrence 1967) were willing to recognise structural regularities in the transfer of land to persons other than agnates: The potential social relationships which can be deduced from titles to land are of great theoretical importance. They represent an interlocking system of rights and obligations which can reinforce purely biological relationships (those of kinship and descent) within the security circle. (Lawrence 1967:114).' <sup id="cite_ref-629" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-629">[629]</a></sup> While fathers were expected to transmit some land to their sons, their were free to transmit the remaining property to other relatives: 'The first question that needs to be resolved, in the case of the Orokaiva, is whether there is really a rule enjoining a man to leave his land to his sons (if he has any). I found the rule to be much more ambiguous. If a man has sons, he is expected to leave them at least half his land, but he is free to dispose of the other half to others - sisters, daughters, adopted children, for example. Thus a degree of freedom of disposition is built into the Orokaiva system. The many cases of non-patrilineal inheritance quoted by Rimoldi, and others I could add, are therefore not exceptions to a rule but the operation of a rule clearly stated by informants. In this discussion, I shall first show on a purely empirical basis that some land transfers are explained by a principle of descent and others on the principle of what Lawrence calls reinforcement of relationships within the security circle. Next, I shall investigate how far the transactional model developed above can provide a principle of higher generality which will sufficiently explain all land transfers, patrilineal and other. In the present section I shall concentrate on transfers within the patrilineage.' <sup id="cite_ref-630" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-630">[630]</a></sup> Usufruct rights in trees and their fruit were transmitted from father to son, but trees were also planted for sister's children: 'Most villagers had lived in several villages, some of which are now abandoned, and had planted coconuts there which they still claim. They usually had similar numbers scattered over parcels of land where they had gardened in the past. Sixty-two per cent of all trees had been planted on the patrimonial land of the person claiming the trees. A man often plants trees while gardening on the land of affines or matrilateral kin and these trees are inherited by the planter's son.' <sup id="cite_ref-631" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-631">[631]</a></sup> 'It is customary for a man to plant a few trees on his own land for his sister's children for their later use. Women sometimes acquire trees of their own in this way but unless a woman is the sole surviving member of the agnatic group in which are vested the rights to the land carrying economic trees which she uses, she acquires no rights to specific trees from her father. After marriage she has only limited access to her patrikin's trees whose produce she previously shared. One householder stated that he would not expect his sister to ask for produce from his trees because her husband should have enough of his own. Another once lodged a formal complaint with the Department of District Administration staff against his sister's husband who had come from another village to harvest one of his trees without first seeking his permission.' <sup id="cite_ref-632" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-632">[632]</a></sup> Accordingly, there was a tension between patrilineal ideology and more ambiguous practice: 'We notice, however, an apparent conflict between patrilineal ideology and practice. According to the ideology, an Orokaiva patrimony is passed on from an enda mama to his successor; there is no rule for splitting up the patrimony between the sons of a deceased enda mama. How does it come about, then, that every extended family has its own enda mama? The process is easy to describe.

In this subdivision, the rights of brothers are supposed to be equal regardless of seniority.' <sup id="cite_ref-633" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-633">[633]</a></sup> Schwimmer therefore speaks of variable and flexible extended families rather than stable lineages: 'In summary, the religious, political and economic attributes of the extended family enable us to describe it undoubtedly as a corporate group. It has to be recognised, however, that the parcels of land controlled by this corporation vary considerably from generation to generation. A corporation will shed parcels which are permanently vested in other lineages, and will obtain new parcels from uterine kin and others. Plant (n.d.), Belshaw (1951), Crocombe and Hogbin (1963) have all treated this land corporation as comprising a ‘lineage’, so that it may seem idiosyncratic that I am calling it an ‘extended family’. My reason for changing the description is that I was unable to find any case of an extended family lacking an enda mama. There are, of course, lineages comprising more than one extended family, but in such cases one finds more than one enda mama. Crocombe and Hogbin, faced with this phenomenon, added the term ‘sub-lineage’ to their pyramid of segmentary patrilineal groupings, but their small sample contains no case of a ‘sub-lineage’ comprising more than one extended family. In these circumstances we may well delay discussion of the range of control of the enda mama until we examine patrilineal ideology in Chapter X.' <sup id="cite_ref-634" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-634">[634]</a></sup></dd>

Land bought from the Orokaivans or claimed as waste and vacant was leased to Europeans on condition that they made improvements. On such land several plantations were established in Northern Division.' <sup id="cite_ref-638" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-638">[638]</a></sup> The colonial authorities also bought land for plantations: 'When the Papuan Act was passed in 1905 by the Australian Commonwealth Parliament, it provided a legal framework for the Australian Administration in the whole of the Territory, of which Northern Division was a part. Ordinances whose provisions had a particular relevance for Northern Division were those that imposed a tax and made cash cropping, carrying and roadbuilding compulsory.' <sup id="cite_ref-639" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-639">[639]</a></sup> 'In spite of lobbying from Europeans, a tax on the indigenous population was not imposed until 1918 when a £2 head tax per annum on adult males was instituted (Griffin et al. 1979:23; Wolfers 1975:34, 37; PAR 1894:v, vii, viii).' <sup id="cite_ref-640" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-640">[640]</a></sup> 'Cash cropping.

Despite the fact that the planting of the communal stands was difficult to enforce and that the copra brought little cash return, by 1914 there were 10,000 planted palms in the Buna area. In 1918 the Native Plantation Ordinance set out more clearly new mechanisms of operation. In accordance with this, in 1921 the Crown started buying land for Native Plantations. Able-bodied men within 5 miles were required to work 60 days a year in lieu of tax. Failure to do so meant that they had to pay tax and, in addition, risk a fine or imprisonment. It was originally envisaged that the produce from the plantation would be divided between villagers and government but, in practice, the produce was sold and the money divided between the villagers and the government. The government's share was to be spent on works benefiting the Papuans. This part of the scheme was never fully implemented. Villagers' returns from the copra sales remained very small and occasionally they expressed their anger at this. Coffee planted under the scheme gave better returns and, by 1939, the areas planted with this cash crop around Higaturu were producing 84 tons of hulled coffee a year.' <sup id="cite_ref-641" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-641">[641]</a></sup> 'In sum then, the mechanisms of pre-war colonialism included a compulsory tax, compulsory cashcropping, compulsory carrying and roadwork.

<p><b>Marriage</b>
</p>
<dl><dd> <b>♠ Monogamy ♣ present ♥</b> eHRAF provides a general description of the marriage and kinship systems: 'Every Orokaiva is recruited by birth into the clan of his or her father. All members of a clan claim, but cannot necessarily trace, common descent from a usually eponymous ancestor. Each clan is subdivided into named subgroups or lineages that trace their origin to a named ancestor.' <sup id="cite_ref-645" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-645">[645]</a></sup> 'Kinship terminology is of the Iroquois type.' <sup id="cite_ref-646" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-646">[646]</a></sup> 'Polygyny among the Orokaiva is accepted but rare. Clan exogamy is preferred, but not strictly enforced. Villages are not exogamous. A large bride-price is required for arranged marriages, although in the past wives were also obtained through capture. Postmarital residence is ideally patrilocal, but in practice people have a wide choice between the villages of patrilateral or matrilateral kin or of affines, and residence may be changed at any time. The distribution of clan branches through a number of villages is closely related to access to the group's land, hence the initial motivation for a long-term change in residence may be influenced by proximity to land intended to be brought into cultivation. Divorce is allowed, with custody of minor children going to the father, except for infants.' <sup id="cite_ref-647" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-647">[647]</a></sup> 'The basic domestic and economic unit is the household, composed of either a nuclear or extended family.' <sup id="cite_ref-648" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-648">[648]</a></sup> Clan membership was patrilineal: 'The Control of Children. Children become members of the father's clan and naturally assume his clan emblem. They thus belong essentially to the father rather than to the mother. In cases of divorce, for example, it is normal for the child to remain in the custody of the father, unless it be an infant at the breast, when the matter may be waived, though compensation is due to the husband. The case of orphans is similar. Although there appears to be no formal adoption they are cared for in the normal case by the people of their father, being regarded indeed as their property.' <sup id="cite_ref-649" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-649">[649]</a></sup> Traditionally, marriages were concluded through purchase, exchange, elopement or capture: 'THE customs relating to marriage will be better understood if it be made clear at the outset that there are four distinct methods by which an Orokaiva can obtain a wife. They are (1) Purchase, (2) Exchange, (3) Elopement, and (4) Capture. The first three of these methods are in continual use to-day; the fourth has fallen out of fashion, but only since the pacification of the country by the white man. Cases of marriage by capture have been very common, and the custom is not so long obsolete but that many women are still to be found in the Division who first met their husbands as members of a hostile raiding party. I shall return to a discussion of these several methods at the end of the chapter.' <sup id="cite_ref-650" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-650">[650]</a></sup> Accordingly, both arranged marriages and elopment were practiced: 'Courtship. Young children are sometimes betrothed by their parents. This transaction is called kerari, and from the beginning the boy's father will make continual presents of food to the girl's people, by which he lays them under an obligation. The kerari, while perfectly regular, is relatively uncommon. Witnesses have said that it invariably implies an exchange, i.e. the adult parties to the transaction each have both a boy and a girl at their disposal. Consequently the gifts of food are in the ordinary instance reciprocal. The kerari betrothal will probably reach a happy ending in marriage, but it is always subject to a sudden alteration when a pubescent girl or boy begins to show wayward preferences. It is said that a parent will urge his daughter to marry the boy she is pledged to without undue delay, for fear she should take a fancy to some other and let her father down by decamping.' <sup id="cite_ref-651" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-651">[651]</a></sup> 'One is happy to say, however, that courtship usually takes a more romantic form than that of child betrothal. There is a word with a somewhat intriguing sound, viz. kigi, which implies clandestine meetings and love-making in the bush. A boy will go to where he knows a girl is at work in [Page 134] the garden, and hiding himself in the bush nearby, will break a dry twig in his fingers, so as to make just enough noise to attract her private attention. The word kigi would seem to apply specifically to this trick. Another way is to make the noise between lips and teeth which by ourselves is commonly associated with kissing, but which bears no such implication to the Orokaiva girl at work in the garden, as she is ignorant of this kind of blandishment. Again, in a man's betava I have seen an article called bohiva which resembles a seed-pod but which is really a receptacle made by an insect for holding and hatching its eggs. It is dry and empty, and when pressed makes a clicking noise like a ping-pong ball. It is used expressly for kigi, and a little girl of eight or nine was covered with the prettiest confusion when the bohiva was pressed before her.' <sup id="cite_ref-652" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-652">[652]</a></sup> 'Sometimes, as we shall see, a youth and girl elope, and in that event we may assume that their previous meetings and love-makings are mostly in secret. But when there is no likely objection to the marriage, he will visit her from time to time by night in her father's house. He knows exactly where to find her, and as the matter has been prearranged he is not likely to meet with a rebuff. There is no actual prohibition against sexual intercourse before marriage, but it is nevertheless regarded as the proper thing for the young couple to abstain. It may seem unlikely that they do abstain, but nevertheless it has been so frequently and consistently asserted that the boy and his sweetheart sleep ‘for nothing’ that one must believe that the statement is at least partly true. It is quite unlikely that young men, when they realize that their questioner has nothing censorious in his attitude, should endeavour to conceal from him what they know is a matter of indifference. I am therefore convinced that there is some truth in the constant assertion of my informants that a great deal of the love-making, even the ‘sleeping together’, is, as we should call it, innocent.' <sup id="cite_ref-653" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-653">[653]</a></sup> Newton claims that marriages concluded through kin relations and brideprice arrangements were more stable: 'Marriages contracted without kin involvement and/or a brideprice could be more prone to dissolution. The long-term results of village elopements are more likely to be modified by brideprice demand. A reasonable brideprice demand encourages a permanent marriage and an unreasonably high brideprice demand tends to dissolve the partnership. The marriages are also less likely to be susceptible to breakdown once both sides of the family have an interest in maintaining the exchange relationships established by the brideprice payment.' <sup id="cite_ref-654" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-654">[654]</a></sup> Married partners were entitled to each other's land and labour: 'As against these male and female obligations, we may note some clearcut rights: the man's right to his wife's labour and the wife's equally important right of unlimited access to the husband's garden land and to its produce. This right extends not only to harvesting food for the household, but also for gifts she may choose to make outside the household, providing that she manages the food supply so as to avoid shortages. A domestic dispute I observed in Sivepe (referred to in Chapter III above) illustrates the importance attached to this married woman's right. When this dispute was adjudicated, the ‘explanation’ of the breakdown of the marriage was found in a single incident, namely the husband's instruction to his wife not to go to his garden again. Here, in the view of everyone present, lay the ‘root’ of the trouble, a judgment with which the husband was willing to agree. This prohibition to go to his garden is one of the few things a husband is on no account to utter to his wife; it amounts to total repudiation of the conjugal relationship.' <sup id="cite_ref-655" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-655">[655]</a></sup> Polygyny was present but uncommon as most marriages were monogamous: 'Polygamy is relatively uncommon. In most of the instances which have come under my notice the wives manage to get on successfully enough with one another, though it is frequently said to be otherwise. I know of one man who ‘threw away’ his first wife because she could not live in [Page 93] amity with his second; of a second wife who, after a quarrel with the first, poisoned herself with derris or ‘New Guinea Dynamite’; and of a husband, formerly a village constable, who was so upset by the wrangling of his two wives as to go away and hang himself. But these instances once more are exceptional, and the polygamous household may be said as a rule to be a peaceful one. Very commonly each wife occupies a separate house, and invariably she works a garden area of her own, so that mutual independence does much to prevent friction.' <sup id="cite_ref-656" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-656">[656]</a></sup> 'In the great majority of instances marriage is monogamous. Whether in the fighting days there existed that surplus of males over females which the modern census reveals, it is impossible to say; but apart from this we are told that every mature and normal man had a wife, so that one finds it difficult to conceive how polygamy could have been very prevalent. In present-day instances the polygamous husband rarely has more than two wives. A certain young man Orari of Isivita, who is of more than usually prepossessing appearance, has divorced one and at present owns three. Asked why he had so many he said it was the girls' fault; they all wanted him. It seems probable, however, that wealth and power rather than personal attraction are the means of winning extra wives. The record instance, as far as my knowledge goes, is that of a man Buninia whose wives are numbered by his surviving contemporaries at eleven. Buninia was a man of great influence among all the Aiga clans, and was notorious for bad temper and bullying. It is said that he was greatly feared. It will go without [Page 131] saying that he was wealthy. I do not know which of these attributes had the greatest influence in winning him eleven wives.' <sup id="cite_ref-657" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-657">[657]</a></sup> The data on exogamy are ambiguous: 'The evidence regarding exogamy is not entirely consistent. Some witnesses have said it is not permissible for a man to marry a woman of his own clan. For this two arguments have been put forward, but neither throws much light on the matter. If a girl married a man of her own clan, where, it was asked, would the pay or bride-price come from? On another occasion a witness said that if a man and wife of the same clan happened to quarrel they would both find themselves calling the name of the same heratu or plant emblem; and the neighbours overhearing would shake their heads or turn up their noses at the idea of marriage between two of the same clan. Other informants have expressed repugnance at the suggestion of marriage with a du or ‘sister’, so that it would appear that in general theory at least the clan should be exogamous. As for the village group (in which there may be several clans), it cannot be called exogamous even in theory. It has been stated, on the contrary, that in a village where there happens to be a number of attractive girls it is a wise thing for the young men of that village to marry them and keep them at home. And this precept was made applicable to the clan itself by some informants; for the rule of clan exogamy was actually in some cases denied.' <sup id="cite_ref-658" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-658">[658]</a></sup> 'When we consult the facts we find that marriage is usually outside the clan, but that the exceptions are numerous enough to prove that clan exogamy is not a hard and fast rule. It also appears that marriage is usually outside the [Page 132] village, though the exceptions are just as numerous. The most notable example came from the Aiga village Ehenada (a large and rambling one, it is true), where of twelve men questioned, all of whom belonged to Ehenada and the clan Asiahije, no less than five had married women of the same village and the same clan. Again in two neighbouring villages of the Simborota clan I found five inter-marriages.' <sup id="cite_ref-659" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-659">[659]</a></sup> 'Marriage is common between first cousins, though in no recorded instance did these cousins belong to one and the same clan. We may probably assume that the marriage of first cousins within the clan is forbidden, although the general rule of clan exogamy is often disregarded. There is no rule against marrying out of one's generation, and I have several cases of marriage between a man and his iai, or daughter in the classificatory sense.' <sup id="cite_ref-660" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-660">[660]</a></sup></dd>

The wife and mother is largely occupied with matters of ménage, and takes little part in wider social activities. Completely overshadowed by the male she seems very well satisfied with her relative unimportance. A woman takes no initiative in matters which concern the clan as a whole, though, when a number of clans are together at a festival and feeling is perhaps strained, she is sometimes known to blow upon the coals. She has a weapon, the poreha or quarterstaff, and in former times would sometimes accompany cannibal raids, acting the part of armour-bearer or assisting in the commissariat.' <sup id="cite_ref-663" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-663">[663]</a></sup>  'To sum up on the social position of woman we may say that she is nominally and often actually under the control of her husband, but that by virtue of his restraint on the one hand and her powers of personal expression on the other, the married couple usually get on very well together as a working unit. In public life, i.e. in the affairs of clan and village, the woman takes only a small part, but is well contented to have it so. She works longer hours than her husband, but her share of labour is not entirely disproportionate; indeed, the popular belief that women do all the work in a native village while their men-folk sprawl about in idleness is quite mistaken. A fairly systematic investigation in two Aiga villages howed that of a total potential working time, men were idle 50 per cent. and women 33 per cent. On the whole it may be safely said that the position of Orokaiva women-indeed of native women in general-is not so slave-like and degraded as popular sentiment imagines.' <sup id="cite_ref-664" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-664">[664]</a></sup> Women's ceremonial roles complemented those of men: 'Some interesting points concerning female roles emerge from the foregoing discussion. In many presentations a woman received gifts according to her status as a member of the clan of her birth or of the clan of her marriage. Thus Cecil's father's sister played a dominant role in the giving of pigs and cows (see Tables 5.5 and 5.8). Women played the most emotional roles in the ritual immediately following death, releasing tension and grief by unrestrained wailing and physical collapse. Their grief was also expressed in the more organized dance of the Mothers' Union. They had a rare opportunity to create their own song and movements. Throughout the funeral, as on other social occasions, women's activities are [Page 159] for the most part separate from, though complementary to, those of the men. In this most important life crisis, however, women, in particular older women, appear to have more autonomy in their actions. They take the initiative in both decision-making and in creativity relating to the exchanges and the mourning surrounding the death.' <sup id="cite_ref-665" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-665">[665]</a></sup> However, women assisted their husbands in warfare and could also incite violence: 'It was customary for women to accompany the expedition carrying pots of food; and they might even stand by their husbands as armour-bearers. Sir William MacGregor, ascending the Kumusi in 1894, noted that ‘The men carried generally a spear and a shield each, with a woman behind him bearing two or three spears. The women were able-bodied, and unaccompanied by children or small boys. Apparently they were simply armour-bearers.’ Again, on the same river in 1895 he met many armed natives, ‘the warrior being frequently followed by a woman carrying part of his panoply, or ready to relieve him of his arms when he was induced to dispense with them.’ The women were always ready to urge on the fighting men and even to mingle in the fray, as W. E. Armit found when in conflict with the natives of Papangi. For then, when the warriors rushed to the attack among the long grass, cheered on by the shrill cries, ‘Cheep! Cheep! Cheep!’, of their women-folk, it was found when they were finally beaten off that two of the women lay dead with spears in their hands.' <sup id="cite_ref-666" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-666">[666]</a></sup> 'The significance of warfare to Orokaivan men is obvious but several descriptions suggest that Orokaivan women were also directly involved. Women had their own weapon, a quarterstaff ‘poreha’ (Williams 1930:163) and on at least one occasion joined in with the men in spear fighting. On most occasions it seems that women used only their staffs and fought alongside men in aggressive sham fights between clans (Waiko 1972, Williams 1930:162-163). They were more noted for their verbal contribution. The people most difficult to pacify were women, who, while doing little actual violence with their … quarterstaffs, were very successfully inciting to violence with their tongues (Williams 1930:163). If a man receives homicidal insignia without having killed, women “jeered at him and cried ‘I think you are a weakling; here's my dress, you'd better wear it’” (Beaver 1920:99). A widow must stay secluded until the capture and killing of a man from the tribe that killed her husband (Williams 1930:170). Hence, in the face of battle, in the training of young men, and in the deprivations suffered by a widow, there is female pressure towards male revenge and homicide. On the more practical level, women often accompanied men on long intertribal raids carrying pots of food and acting as armour bearers during battle (Williams 1930:164; P.A.R. 1892-3:34, 1895-6:29). However the most important fighting roles fell upon the men and there is no doubt that fighting withdrew them from the labour force on more occasions and for longer periods than it did the women.' <sup id="cite_ref-667" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-667">[667]</a></sup> However, women were denied some insignia: 'The posthumous honour of a bahari is denied to a woman for a curious reason which I have heard several times repeated. Women are too fond of bivije or adulterous intercourse, and are therefore undeserving of the dignity of an elevated position. They are laid on a mat on the ground, and the only real regret for them is said to be on the part of those who have enjoyed their favours. And since these latter are ashamed to weep for fear of betraying themselves, the woman goes unwept and unhonoured to her grave. This explanation, needless to say, was derived from male informants, and, in point of fact, the demonstrations of grief at a woman's death are hardly less extravagant than at a man's.' <sup id="cite_ref-668" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-668">[668]</a></sup> It appears that women could not become 'big men' (see also institutional variables). We have provisionally considered this to be difference in 'legal rights', although a formal legal system was absent and the applicability of this variable to the Orokaiva is limited.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Social class ♣ absent ♥</b> Orokaiva society was organized in patrilineal clans rather than social classes: 'Every Orokaiva is recruited by birth into the clan of his or her father. All members of a clan claim, but cannot necessarily trace, common descent from a usually eponymous ancestor. Each clan is subdivided into named subgroups or lineages that trace their origin to a named ancestor.' <sup id="cite_ref-669" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-669">[669]</a></sup> 'Kinship terminology is of the Iroquois type.' <sup id="cite_ref-670" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-670">[670]</a></sup> Typically, multiple clans were present in one locality: 'The social system is characterized by flexibility in arrangements for group membership and for transmission of rights to land. A village normally contains more than one clan branch and consequently is not necessarily a landholding unit. Residents may have closer kinship ties to residents of other villages than with some of their coresidents. Nevertheless, common residence implies some community of interest and a degree of group solidarity that is reinforced by government policy, which recognizes villages rather than descent groups as functional entities. Marriages between members of different clan branches within the village also reinforce this solidarity, which is expressed in ways such as daily food gifts, cooperation in certain tasks, and joint ceremonial activities. On the average, a lineage comprises three households. Usually, several clans are represented in a village, with members of a single clan (clan branches) being scattered among a number of neighboring villages. Lineages are more localized in cha racter, frequently being confined to a single village and tending to occupy one section of it.' <sup id="cite_ref-671" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-671">[671]</a></sup> Political organization was decentralized: 'Political organization incorporates no central authority or hereditary leadership. Instead, it is characterized by big-men(EMBO DAMBO) and an ascendancy of elders who have proved themselves equal to the task. Such men command the respect of the village, based upon observed qualities of generosity, diligence, wealth, ability to make wise decisions, and skill in arranging ceremonial activities. This status confers no sanctioning authority, however. The Orokaiva tribes, around twelve in number, are very loose units politically and recognize no single leader. The largest unit is the tribe, which has a common territory usually demarcated from neighboring tribal territories by a belt of uninhabited land.' <sup id="cite_ref-672" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-672">[672]</a></sup> 'Big men' exercised informal authority only and relied on their ability to recruit followers: 'Again all the underlings of any ‘big man’ will be known to others under his name. In the Sangara dialect there is a word tekahoka, of which I do not know the literal meaning, but which appears to stand for a ‘following’. When, at a gathering of the clans for war, or for some peaceful ceremony, [Page 104] the several parties make their appearance each following in single file behind its leader, a cry will go up, ‘Here come the people, the Tekahoka, of Embuja, of Ehari, of Andari!’-whoever the big man may be. So in the Aiga language there is a word ambotani, which embraces all a man's junior relatives; and thus a number of more or less unimportant individuals may be known to others as the juniors of a certain big man and identified by his name.' <sup id="cite_ref-673" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-673">[673]</a></sup> 'There is no well-defined chieftainship among the Orokaiva, but merely a recognized ascendancy of the old men. The leader and ruler of any clan is the eldest of its men, provided he is not so old as to be incompetent, and provided always that his personality is equal to his position. It is consequently difficult to find a word which would correspond with our idea of ‘chief’, and unsatisfactory to use the English word ‘chief’, as too pretentious for even the most important of clan leaders. The Orokaiva expressions as far as I know them are embo-be (a proper man), and embopeni, embo-pajirari, embo-paitukiari, and embo-siakabada (all of which mean no more than ‘big or important man’); and these terms may be used of men of importance who cannot claim to be actually leaders. There are two other terms, however, which seem to possess a more specific application: they are embo-javoari and embo-penjavo. The first appears to mean ‘the man who gives the name’ (javo), and the second is no doubt a contraction of embo-peni-javo (man-big-name). The implication is that the real chief is the man who gives his name to his followers, i.e. the man by whose name they are collectively known.' <sup id="cite_ref-674" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-674">[674]</a></sup> Generosity was culturally valued and also served as a major recruitment mechanism: 'Perhaps the most characteristic of them all is liberality. The liberal man is handembo, the word hande meaning distribution, or especially the sharing out of food. It is easy to understand how this should be a popular virtue, for the Orokaiva, like other natives, are much addicted to the making of feasts-and not because of a merely gluttonous appetite, as some who know least about natives have supposed, but more because of the glamour and the excitement of a social gathering. It is true we cannot acquit the handembo of a certain motive of self-display; for there is nothing, not valour in war nor prowess in the chase, that brings an Orokaiva so prominently into the public eye as the providing of a big feast. Yet no one could deny the existence of true generosity. This is shown in countless details of daily life. The paddler pauses to refresh himself with cold cooked taro; he wrenches a mouthful with his strong teeth and hands the lump without a word to the man behind him, as a boy might give his chum a bite out of the apple. Or when the carriers halt for a ‘smokeoh’ and receive their stick of tobacco, there is never one of them but has a puff or two; and when they push on again with their loads, a man will place a half-finished cigarette on a stump by the track, and another coming behind will hastily snatch it, take a few draws, and leave it once more on another stump fifty yards farther on for the next man.' <sup id="cite_ref-675" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-675">[675]</a></sup> 'For his liberality a man receives a reward of honour; but beyond that-and this should not be thought to disqualify it entirely as a virtue-he constantly looks for an equal return in kind. This is one of the striking features of primitive economics-the return of gift for gift, the maintaining of a balance. The return may be made long subsequently, but it may be called a matter of honour to equal or exceed the original gift; just as it is a matter of disgrace and lowered self-esteem to fail. There can be no question that self-display enters into the primitive virtue of liberality, and it is in respect of worldly wealth that the individual seeks most to display himself. One might almost say that the native made a virtue of wealth and that liberality was compounded of two things-mere wealth and true generosity.' <sup id="cite_ref-676" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-676">[676]</a></sup> Traditionally, slayers were entitled to special honours, such as the taking of names and the wearing of insignia, but there was no 'warrior class': 'The usual native explanation of the practice under discussion is that the name of the slain is adopted as a distinction. It draws attention to the fact that a man is embo-dari or mai-dari, i.e. a man-slayer, and marks him, therefore, as one of valour, koropahuso, ‘strong or expert with the spear’. It serves to commemorate his exploit.' <sup id="cite_ref-677" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-677">[677]</a></sup> 'There is another kind of distinction, viz. the wearing of certain ornaments, &amp;c., which may be described as homicidal insignia. To these is given the general name otohu, or the specific name of esa. The latter will be found more satisfactory here. The subject of these insignia among the Orokaiva is not so straightforward as we might expect, owing to the fact-a happy one from all points of view save the present-that homicide has long gone out of fashion, or at least no longer bears an honorific implication, so that the customs connected with it cannot be studied directly. The best written on the subject is found in the admirable article by the late W. N. Beaver in the Annual Report, 1918-19, pp. 96-9.' <sup id="cite_ref-678" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-678">[678]</a></sup> 'The source of confusion is in the fact that otohu ornaments are also given in connexion with initiation, where they certainly do not imply that the recipient has been a man-slayer. The concrete fact that they are given to girls as well as to boys or men is enough to prove this. Beaver [Page 178] made a distinction between homicidal otohu and ‘pig-otohu’, the former being conditioned by the killing of a man, the latter virtually bought with a pig. My own inquiries confirm this distinction, though I would attach more importance to the latter class than he does, and would prefer to state the matter thus, that the esa, or homicidal insignia, are a special class of otohu. The general subject of otohu will be discussed in the next chapter.' <sup id="cite_ref-679" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-679">[679]</a></sup> 'In the meantime it appears that the man-slayer, having undergone the forms of purification or exorcism, might at some convenient date receive his otohu, or, as I shall call it, qua homicidal insigne, his esa. I say ‘might’ because some of the older informants have assured me that an esa was not given invariably. Moreover, it seems that certain ornaments, which are rightly enough otohu, have been too freely regarded as esa, i.e. as implying that their possessor must be a homicide. My own inquiries have led me to believe that the variety of homicidal insignia was very limited. Beaver has given two lists, one for the coastal and central tribes and one for the Wasida and the trans-Kumusi. The first is of eight, and the second of twelve alternative ornaments or objects. (It will be understood that the River People in the north observe similar customs and use similar esa.) I do not repeat these in full, but draw attention to several of the more striking. It seems likely that Nos. 1 and 2 (the hornbill beaks and the cuscus fur) were exclusive homicidal insignia or esa proper, i.e. they could be worn only by man-slayers. But save for these two, and possibly though doubtfully for the other three mentioned with them, I am led to believe that the long list of ornaments given by Beaver, as well as many others mentioned by native informants, were presented just as readily to the peaceful initiate as to the successful warrior.' <sup id="cite_ref-680" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-680">[680]</a></sup> 'Beaver has given some interesting hints as to the symbolism of various esa. For example, the Bati-ananya symbolizes ‘the clawing hands and grinning teeth of the dead’. Again, ‘simba-a head-dress of dogs’ teeth, “sapi sapi” shells and beads, symbolical of the head smashed in by the stone club (?)’. The interrogation mark in the latter case makes it appear as if the writer did not entirely trust his informant, and while such symbolic interpretations are worth recording, we may well doubt whether they are the generally accepted interpretations, or, indeed, whether any general interpretation exists. It is not impossible that the above meanings are the extempore creations of imaginative informants reading their own meaning into the object on the spur of the moment; and I dare say that if we sought them we could discover a variety of symbolic interpretations for any one esa.' <sup id="cite_ref-681" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-681">[681]</a></sup> 'The main purpose of the esa is apparently honorific. To the Orokaiva it is, or was, an ambition to kill a man, and the man-slayer was in a manner lionized. When a warrior who already had a victim to his credit held an enemy at his mercy, he might forbear out of generosity and call on another to administer the finishing blow, and so earn the right of wearing what to an Orokaiva was perhaps the proudest possible distinction.' <sup id="cite_ref-682" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-682">[682]</a></sup> Williams describes various insignia and their bestowal: 'It is the invariable custom to call upon some old warrior of distinction to bestow these ornaments: such a man is called aguma or atemba. On this occasion at Divina Kovari there were three of them, and I shall describe their part in the ceremony at some length.' <sup id="cite_ref-683" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-683">[683]</a></sup> 'The Otohu. It remains now to say something further of the otohu. I have already referred to the homicidal otohu, or esa, in Chapter XI, and described the rites observed in the bestowal of the ordinary otohu in the present chapter. It is now our task to consider the meaning-or the various meanings-of the word. The otohu may for the present be defined as one of a number of distinctive ornaments or objects which, at a price, are ceremonially bestowed, and which the recipient is thenceforward entitled to wear or use. It will be understood that any one who was, so to speak, masquerading with an otohu would be exposed to obloquy or ridicule. In earlier days it is doubtful whether any man would have had the hardihood or folly to attempt it. Where, therefore, one sees a man holding a highly ornamented lime gourd with a shell mouth-piece, or a string bag decorated with dogs' teeth, or wearing cuscus streamers tied at intervals with bunches of feathers, it may be concluded that he has paid the price for them (or probably that the price has been paid in his behalf) and that he is fully entitled to their use.'  <sup id="cite_ref-684" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-684">[684]</a></sup> 'There is a considerable variety of these ceremonial objects, e.g. a specially ornamented bo or string bag (eti or hetava), decorated spears or stone clubs, bone forks for eating, lime-pots, belts embroidered with saima shells or made of black creeper cord, cuscus streamers, &amp;c. More commonly they take the form of ornaments (hambo) for the breast or forehead-hornbill beaks set in a half-circle, gana, huave, bono, and the like (vide p. 39). They are always fine examples of their kind, and in some cases are extremely [Page 202] ornate, with pendants and rosettes of dogs' teeth and scarlet seeds. They do not take the form of feather head-dresses, which constitute what I have throughout called the kokumbari. It will be understood, though, that the word kokumbari means literally ‘decorate’, and might correctly be applied to the otohu. A distinction is sometimes drawn between dikokumbari (bird or feather decoration) and hambo-kokumbari (ornament decoration), the latter, of course, meaning the otohu. However, I shall continue to restrict the word ‘kokumbari’ to the feather decorations which every initiate receives, and which are, as it were, cheaper than the otohu.' <sup id="cite_ref-685" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-685">[685]</a></sup> 'I have been assured that, whereas the kokumbari is given properly by the nobo, the otohu is given by the mama (not the actual father, but one of the paternal uncles); but we find that the latter rule, like the former, will not come well out of the wash. It is customary, of course, for the candidate's parents to supply the pig which is the price of the otohu. (In some cases he does so himself.) The father will bespeak the services of some other-a craftsman-to make the actual ornament, and this man (the otohu-embo) is called upon as much for his skill and artistry as for any special relationship he bears to the boy. Among twenty-one cases it appeared that the otohu-embo was mama to the candidate in nine (in one of them he was the real father), nobo in six, bitepemi in three, nabori in one, ahije (grandfather) in one, and in the last he was of no recognized relationship but merely otavo, or friend, to the candidate's father.' <sup id="cite_ref-686" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-686">[686]</a></sup> 'There is no actual social necessity for every man to receive an otohu, though it seems probable that at some time or other nearly every one does. And these further points are significant, that one person may receive a number of them at different times, and that he may receive them at any age.' <sup id="cite_ref-687" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-687">[687]</a></sup> 'The usual occasion for presenting them is at the kokumbari ceremony in which the recipients are sometimes quite young children who are still a long way from puberty. Again, as we have seen, the otohu may be given to the manslayer (though this is not absolutely invariable). But it appears further that an opportunity for bestowing an otohu might be made at any and every ceremony. Thus, for instance, [Page 203] at a dance in Petakiari, when a widow ceremonially discarded her mourning jacket of baja, or Job's Tears, she was presented with an otohu in the form of a specially decorated bo, and this with all the usual formalities.' <sup id="cite_ref-688" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-688">[688]</a></sup> 'In view of these facts we may regard the otohu as embodying a social distinction. It implies that its owner has paid a pig, or that it has been paid in his behalf, and thus the ornament has been formally and regularly acquired. Further, to the native who loves ostentation the otohu is worth having for its own sake, apart from any social distinction it may connote: it is a fine thing, for instance, to wear a ‘magnet-shaped’ shell ornament (mendo) passed through one's nose-hole and dangling somewhat awkwardly in front of one's lips, or to sit and rattle one's spatula noisily in the shell mouth-piece of an otohu lime-pot. In short the otohu has both honorific and decorative value.' <sup id="cite_ref-689" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-689">[689]</a></sup> However, these traits do not constitute a 'class system' and we therefore cannot speak of different legal rights for different social classes.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Ethnicity or race ♣ absent ♥</b> Non-Orokaiva 'outsider wives' were often treated with suspicion and had trouble integrating into the community: 'The ‘outsider’ wife, from beyond traditional affinal links, faces more specific problems when living with her husband in his village. Her initial lack of ability to grow and harvest subsistence crops different from those of her own area is a major cause for her husband's annoyance. Her inability to speak Orokaivan and her cultural difference makes acceptance and support from other village wives slower to develop. She is too far away from home to call on the support of her male relatives when in trouble. For instance, while I was in the field a woman from Madang was beaten and burnt by her husband on two separate occasions. Although Koropata wives would go to her aid in the morning, only two youths from another clan made a token visit, wishing to show some concern and aware that the woman was well away from the determent of male kin. Wives from distant provinces pined for their own families and lamented the great cost of fares to visit home, beyond anything they could save from market sales.' <sup id="cite_ref-690" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-690">[690]</a></sup> 'I noted only two cases of an outside wife being installed in the village without her husband. Such women were criticized for not understanding the traditional subsistence techniques of the area, for being lazy, and for failing to behave properly at feasts. In one case a woman from the Gulf Province was sent to live with the household of her husband's brother. She had with her a female relative. At special dinners they were not included in the meal, eating separately at the back of the room. At one feast distribution the young wife, seemingly tired of being snubbed, threw down the small share given to her and brought down the wrath of the host family. In the evenings, speeches were made in the special parable form known to the older people, making reference to the laziness and ignorance of the two Gulf women. They were social isolates, communicating with few people and excluded from comprehending the Orokaivan conversations around.' <sup id="cite_ref-691" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-691">[691]</a></sup> However, this appears to be due to prejudice rather than an explicit difference of 'legal' rights. There was no explicit 'ethnic' stratification among the native population. But the native population found itself at the bottom of an imperial interethnic hierarchy once colonial administrators and European settlers had established themselves: 'There is currently some covert aggression towards the European settlers, some of whom reciprocate in a more overt manner. The history of European contact has not always been happy. Frequent misunderstanding and misinterpretation by both sides has led to strained social relations in many cases. The initial settlement of Europeans in the area resulted in bloodshed and ill-feeling. Early miners and police both had cause to fear the Orokaiva. Later government attempts to enforce cash cropping met strong resistance in some areas. The Japanese invasion and its subsequent defeat led to many confusing and bewildering Orokaiva deaths. Since the last war there has been some improvement of the race relations - but they are still basically seen in some type of dominance relationship, e.g., master - labourer, teacher - pupil, etc. The Anglican church has ordained a few priests and in general has congenial relations with the Orokaiva, yet this does not necessarily suggest a closer empathy with or understanding of the people. The Orokaiva regard some resident Europeans as welcome and fairly warmly received and others as being unwelcome trespassers. More Europeans appear to be in the latter category than is generally realized.' <sup id="cite_ref-692" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-692">[692]</a></sup> 'Like any enclave in a foreign country the European settlers attribute stereotyped characteristics of personality and temperament to particular local groups. This process of one group classifying another into psychological types provides a working basis for interaction. The Orokaiva were quickly allotted a stereotype and this came to be reinforced as the ascribed characteristics were searched for and found. The Orokaiva were classed as being ‘surly’, ‘resentful’, ‘sulking’, ‘good policemen but need [Page 7] to be kept under control’. Europeans now living in the Northern District tend to make such wide generalizations. They also tend to allot unique stereotypes to subgroups such as villages or tribes.' <sup id="cite_ref-693" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-693">[693]</a></sup> The code refers to the Orokaiva themselves rather than the colonial system as a whole.

<dd><b>♠ Property can be owned by both males and females ♣ present ♥</b> Orokaiva society was organized in patrilineal clans rather than social classes: 'Every Orokaiva is recruited by birth into the clan of his or her father.

Each clan is subdivided into named subgroups or lineages that trace their origin to a named ancestor.' <sup id="cite_ref-697" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-697">[697]</a></sup> 'Kinship terminology is of the Iroquois type.' <sup id="cite_ref-698" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-698">[698]</a></sup> Clans and lineages held and transmitted lands, but individual men owned and distributed garden plots within lineage territory: 'Inheritance is usually patrilineal.' <sup id="cite_ref-699" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-699">[699]</a></sup> 'Various land rights may be given to the clan branch, the lineage, or an individual, the relative significance of each varying with the locality and population density. More than one descent group may have rights in a single piece of land. In many instances, the clan branch functions as a reference group, with all land being associated with it. However, it may also function as a primary right-holding group for those hunting areas distinct from current garden land, typically the grasslands. Primary rights to garden land are normally vested in the lineage. Nevertheless, all such land is ultimately identifiable with individuals who may distribute land (and property) prior to their death not only to their immediate family but also to more distant kin. Traditional tree crops are not planted in stands or groups like cash-crop trees but are widely scattered and are as likely to be planted on patrimonial land as on the land of affines or matrilateral kin. Inheritance of rights to trees usually does not bring rights to the land on which they stand.' <sup id="cite_ref-700" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-700">[700]</a></sup> Williams provides a general description of the property system: 'Before we can fully understand the system of using the land, it is necessary to describe the system under which it is owned. Among the Orokaiva there is a multiplicity of small clans, which from time to time increases by subdivision (a process which is in part neutralized by the dying out of older clans). Now the land is owned in reality by the clan. The fact that very commonly the clan is a local unity, being often coincident with the single village, makes this system a simple one in the normal instance. Sometimes, however, the clan is somewhat [Page 125] scattered, occupying several villages or parts of several villages. In this case the clan will in all probability retain a nominal ownership of all its lands; but in practice it is customary for the various sections to assume by general consent or else by the allocation of a headman, the occupation and usage of particular parts of the land. In due time the section is likely to adopt a distinctive name, and to develop into an independent clan: the right of usage tacitly becomes ownership, and we find the normal condition restored, viz. the clan locally unified and in possession of its own tracts of land. A system exactly similar governs the ownership of the small waterways (useful for fishing) and of the sago swamps.' <sup id="cite_ref-701" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-701">[701]</a></sup> 'The Orokaiva clan is virtually a patriarchal group; there is no real chieftainship, but a recognized ascendancy of the old man, provided his vigour of mind and body is equal to his position. As it begins to fail his place is gradually occupied by a younger man. Only in the larger clans, where there are well-defined family groups, does the question of hereditary succession appear, and then it is a somewhat faint appearance.' <sup id="cite_ref-702" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-702">[702]</a></sup> 'It is sometimes said that the chief owns the land, though this is hardly more than a form of speech. He does something, however, towards administering it. For instance, he can say which area is to be laid under cultivation at any time, and he can subdivide and allot the territory of the clan among its branches. He feels himself and is felt to be the guardian of the land. Thus we hear an old man telling how his father had given him death-bed injunctions-‘Friday he talk, Saturday he die,’ as the interpreter put it in order to make clear the testamentary nature of the charge-to allow all his own people to make their gardens on the clan's territory, but to suffer no strangers.' <sup id="cite_ref-703" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-703">[703]</a></sup> 'Among the members of the clan there is a very considerable amount of personal freedom, and, except in so far as there may be an allocation of land and fishing rights between branches or families, they may in theory make their gardens where they please. There is occasional [Page 126] wrangling as to garden boundaries, but these petty disagreements within the clan, so to speak, are as a rule easily settled. The land disputes which bring endless trouble and labour to the magistrate are disputes between clans. While the land is owned communally the garden is owned individually. Between two adjacent gardens the boundary is made of felled trees, laid end to end, sometimes in two rows so as to form a path between. So long as this ground is under cultivation, not only the produce of the garden but the garden itself is individual property, and a displacement of the boundary would mean a quarrel.' <sup id="cite_ref-704" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-704">[704]</a></sup> Women relied on their husbands for access to garden plots: 'As against these male and female obligations, we may note some clearcut rights: the man's right to his wife's labour and the wife's equally important right of unlimited access to the husband's garden land and to its produce. This right extends not only to harvesting food for the household, but also for gifts she may choose to make outside the household, providing that she manages the food supply so as to avoid shortages. A domestic dispute I observed in Sivepe (referred to in Chapter III above) illustrates the importance attached to this married woman's right. When this dispute was adjudicated, the ‘explanation’ of the breakdown of the marriage was found in a single incident, namely the husband's instruction to his wife not to go to his garden again. Here, in the view of everyone present, lay the ‘root’ of the trouble, a judgment with which the husband was willing to agree. This prohibition to go to his garden is one of the few things a husband is on no account to utter to his wife; it amounts to total repudiation of the conjugal relationship.' <sup id="cite_ref-705" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-705">[705]</a></sup> But property in movables, such as household items, was owned by individuals and individual families: 'Equipment such as sewing machines, fishing nets and shotguns is usually owned by an individual household head or his household. Use by members of other households should be compensated in some way, as by percentage of the catch, but such compensatory sharing is difficult to implement in the case of a sewing machine. Tools for daily garden work are owned individually but are shared by all members of the household. Males own axes, spears, shotguns and building tools. Females own string bags, sewing machines, and personal fishing nets. Not all households have housebuilding tools, but these are commonly lent to close relatives outside the household. All tools except sago gathering equipment and the hunting nets of the past are for use by an individual. A valuable item such as a sewing machine intended for communal use may be appropriated by a particular individual unless it is stored in a ‘neutral’ separate place.' <sup id="cite_ref-706" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-706">[706]</a></sup> 'All Koropatan households do own the essential equipment for daily work. Information on types of property also reveals the extent of the substitution of Western technology for traditional manufactures. Property lists are almost identical with those prepared by Waddell and Krinks (1968). The Tables 4.7 to 4.10 are short summaries of the household ownership of specific representative goods which can reveal the extent of the differences among households. The numbers of items are clustered in such a way that variation between households is meaningful.' <sup id="cite_ref-707" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-707">[707]</a></sup> 'There is quite a wide variation in ownership of traditional wealth. Most own one to five tapa cloths and one to three pigs, but in each case there are those with none, and those with several more. The difference in the ownership of traditional decorations is even more marked; several households have up to 200 items, and many have fewer than ten.' <sup id="cite_ref-708" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-708">[708]</a></sup> 'Differentiation in ownership of modern property is just as marked.

There is, as a rule, so much ground to spare that he is welcome to begin where he pleases, and without the risk of offending a fellow clansman. It does sometimes happen, however, that a man acquires a sort of prescriptive right to the immediate [Page 129] locality where he has worked, and accordingly we sometimes find an easy-going division of an area between families or branches of the clan. No doubt this becomes a stricter division where the available land is circumscribed; for individual ownership of land probably has its origin in scarcity of land.' <sup id="cite_ref-722" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-722">[722]</a></sup> The interests of clans and families could be at odds with each other: 'It is only necessary to stress the point that the immediate family is recognized as a social unit; and the mere fact that a man sometimes quarrels with the members of his clan and migrates with his family or settles somewhere apart, proves that the family interest may compete with that of the clan. Both units are co-operative, the family especially in respect of the food quest, the clan in respect of ceremonies and feasts, and more importantly of fighting. The clan owns the garden land, but the family cultivates its own patch and reaps its own harvest. On the whole, since the clan displays a constant tendency to split into smaller groups of which the family is the nucleus, it is difficult to draw a line between the two. Yet for the same reason we may be right in saying that the family, as the indivisible unit, exerts the stronger hold.' <sup id="cite_ref-723" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-723">[723]</a></sup> Owners of garden plots built magical markers and barriers in order to protect them from intruders: 'With respect to property it is worth noting under this head the various tangible protection marks. Whatever their sanctions they have no real value as physical barriers to trespass or appropriation.' <sup id="cite_ref-724" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-724">[724]</a></sup> '(1) The commonest is papara or ese, the frond of coco-nut palm tied about the butt, which means that no one is to [Page 324] climb for nuts. (2) The heri is a strip of bark or a liana tied to uprights and encircling a house or some forbidden ground. (3) A harihari is some object, usually leaf or twig, placed in the cleft of a split stick and set up, e.g., at the mouth of a creek as a sign of a fishing right. (4) Inja is simply a few handfuls of grass laid across a track to bar the passage. We might include (5) the naterari and pamba (p. 226), which serve to mark a village tabu on the coco-nuts, and (6) logically enough the ordinary garden boundary, tani, which consists merely of a series of tree-trunks or branches laid on the ground between adjacent plots. These are all regarded quite strictly: no man would step over an inja or take a short cut across an area enclosed by a heri. Less regular marks which may serve as reminders for some casual rule are observed with equal stringency. For instance, I have seen an eight of diamonds wedged in a split stick and set up in a village to forbid the playing of cards; it had been erected by a man of influence who has somehow acquired conscientious scruples regarding the forbidden game. The sanctions for the strict observance of these marks will be discussed presently; the signs themselves are described here merely to show the existence of tangible safeguards, principally, but not always, of the law of property.' <sup id="cite_ref-725" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-725">[725]</a></sup> We are unsure whether land was equally distributed among the individual clans, but there was definitely no 'land-holding caste' as every man owned garden plots for family consumption.</dd></dl>

<dd><b>♠ Education is available to people from all ethnic/racial groups ♣ absent: 1884-1900 CE; present: 1901-1942 CE ♥</b> During the colonial period, Anglican missions established schools: 'Errant children are subject to beating and especially to scolding. Education is predominantly through a system of mission schools, partly financed by the government's department of education.' <sup id="cite_ref-726" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-726">[726]</a></sup> 'Hospitals and schools. The mission during this period seemed more detached from and independent of the Administration and commercial interests than it had been previously. However, structurally the mission became strongly tied to the Administration in the areas of medicine and education. The government encouraged such humanitarian activities as they improved relations between the colonized and colonizers but, lacking finance itself, was relieved that the mission took on most of the responsibility. So the Administration merely gave some financial subsidy and promoted the use of the growing mission services.  Government reports in 1909 stated that twenty-four schools were operating in the Northern Division. The first mission hospital was established at Buna  in 1913. In 1930, medical services were provided at six other small mission stations: Eroro, Sangara, Duvira, Gona, Isivita and Ambasi (see Fig. 2.4 and Wetherell 1977:241, 276, 311; Feetham 1917:13, 15; Shevill 1949:112, 110).' <sup id="cite_ref-727" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-727">[727]</a></sup> However, only a small number of Orokaiva were literate prior to WW II: 'For the rest, the skills acquired by Orokaiva over the last 15 years are largely concerned not directly with village development but rather with an increase of understanding of the world outside. While before the war, only a small minority had school education, the Anglican Mission spread its operations to several new stations, including Sasembata, after the war. After the eruption, the scope of education was again greatly extended and it could be said that the eruption marked the beginning of universal school education in the majority of Orokaiva villages.' <sup id="cite_ref-728" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-728">[728]</a></sup> [Even in colonial settlements, services were of a makeshift character.] We have adopted 1900 as a provisional date of transition, but this is open to review. We have assumed that access to mission schools was not determined by gender, clan membership or ethnicity. This is open to review and more material on mission schoools may be needed.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ Property can be owned by people from all ethnic/racial groups ♣ present ♥</b> Non-Orokaiva 'outsider wives' were often treated with suspicion and had trouble integrating into the community: 'The ‘outsider’ wife, from beyond traditional affinal links, faces more specific problems when living with her husband in his village. Her initial lack of ability to grow and harvest subsistence crops different from those of her own area is a major cause for her husband's annoyance. Her inability to speak Orokaivan and her cultural difference makes acceptance and support from other village wives slower to develop. She is too far away from home to call on the support of her male relatives when in trouble. For instance, while I was in the field a woman from Madang was beaten and burnt by her husband on two separate occasions. Although Koropata wives would go to her aid in the morning, only two youths from another clan made a token visit, wishing to show some concern and aware that the woman was well away from the determent of male kin. Wives from distant provinces pined for their own families and lamented the great cost of fares to visit home, beyond anything they could save from market sales.' <sup id="cite_ref-729" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-729">[729]</a></sup> 'I noted only two cases of an outside wife being installed in the village without her husband. Such women were criticized for not understanding the traditional subsistence techniques of the area, for being lazy, and for failing to behave properly at feasts. In one case a woman from the Gulf Province was sent to live with the household of her husband's brother. She had with her a female relative. At special dinners they were not included in the meal, eating separately at the back of the room. At one feast distribution the young wife, seemingly tired of being snubbed, threw down the small share given to her and brought down the wrath of the host family. In the evenings, speeches were made in the special parable form known to the older people, making reference to the laziness and ignorance of the two Gulf women. They were social isolates, communicating with few people and excluded from comprehending the Orokaivan conversations around.' <sup id="cite_ref-730" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-730">[730]</a></sup> However, this appears to be due to prejudice rather than an explicit difference of 'legal' rights. Non-Orokaiva wives still had access to their husbands' garden plots and probably also owned some household items.</dd></dl>

A village normally contains more than one clan branch and consequently is not necessarily a landholding unit. Residents may have closer kinship ties to residents of other villages than with some of their coresidents. Nevertheless, common residence implies some community of interest and a degree of group solidarity that is reinforced by government policy, which recognizes villages rather than descent groups as functional entities. Marriages between members of different clan branches within the village also reinforce this solidarity, which is expressed in ways such as daily food gifts, cooperation in certain tasks, and joint ceremonial activities. On the average, a lineage comprises three households. Usually, several clans are represented in a village, with members of a single clan (clan branches) being scattered among a number of neighboring villages. Lineages are more localized in cha racter, frequently being confined to a single village and tending to occupy one section of it.' <sup id="cite_ref-735" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-735">[735]</a></sup> Political organization was decentralized: 'Political organization incorporates no central authority or hereditary leadership. Instead, it is characterized by big-men(EMBO DAMBO) and an ascendancy of elders who have proved themselves equal to the task. Such men command the respect of the village, based upon observed qualities of generosity, diligence, wealth, ability to make wise decisions, and skill in arranging ceremonial activities. This status confers no sanctioning authority, however. The Orokaiva tribes, around twelve in number, are very loose units politically and recognize no single leader. The largest unit is the tribe, which has a common territory usually demarcated from neighboring tribal territories by a belt of uninhabited land.' <sup id="cite_ref-736" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-736">[736]</a></sup> 'Big men' exercised informal authority only and relied on their ability to recruit followers: 'Again all the underlings of any ‘big man’ will be known to others under his name. In the Sangara dialect there is a word tekahoka, of which I do not know the literal meaning, but which appears to stand for a ‘following’. When, at a gathering of the clans for war, or for some peaceful ceremony, [Page 104] the several parties make their appearance each following in single file behind its leader, a cry will go up, ‘Here come the people, the Tekahoka, of Embuja, of Ehari, of Andari!’-whoever the big man may be. So in the Aiga language there is a word ambotani, which embraces all a man's junior relatives; and thus a number of more or less unimportant individuals may be known to others as the juniors of a certain big man and identified by his name.' <sup id="cite_ref-737" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-737">[737]</a></sup> 'There is no well-defined chieftainship among the Orokaiva, but merely a recognized ascendancy of the old men. The leader and ruler of any clan is the eldest of its men, provided he is not so old as to be incompetent, and provided always that his personality is equal to his position. It is consequently difficult to find a word which would correspond with our idea of ‘chief’, and unsatisfactory to use the English word ‘chief’, as too pretentious for even the most important of clan leaders. The Orokaiva expressions as far as I know them are embo-be (a proper man), and embopeni, embo-pajirari, embo-paitukiari, and embo-siakabada (all of which mean no more than ‘big or important man’); and these terms may be used of men of importance who cannot claim to be actually leaders. There are two other terms, however, which seem to possess a more specific application: they are embo-javoari and embo-penjavo. The first appears to mean ‘the man who gives the name’ (javo), and the second is no doubt a contraction of embo-peni-javo (man-big-name). The implication is that the real chief is the man who gives his name to his followers, i.e. the man by whose name they are collectively known.' <sup id="cite_ref-738" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-738">[738]</a></sup> Generosity was culturally valued and also served as a major recruitment mechanism: 'Perhaps the most characteristic of them all is liberality. The liberal man is handembo, the word hande meaning distribution, or especially the sharing out of food. It is easy to understand how this should be a popular virtue, for the Orokaiva, like other natives, are much addicted to the making of feasts-and not because of a merely gluttonous appetite, as some who know least about natives have supposed, but more because of the glamour and the excitement of a social gathering. It is true we cannot acquit the handembo of a certain motive of self-display; for there is nothing, not valour in war nor prowess in the chase, that brings an Orokaiva so prominently into the public eye as the providing of a big feast. Yet no one could deny the existence of true generosity. This is shown in countless details of daily life. The paddler pauses to refresh himself with cold cooked taro; he wrenches a mouthful with his strong teeth and hands the lump without a word to the man behind him, as a boy might give his chum a bite out of the apple. Or when the carriers halt for a ‘smokeoh’ and receive their stick of tobacco, there is never one of them but has a puff or two; and when they push on again with their loads, a man will place a half-finished cigarette on a stump by the track, and another coming behind will hastily snatch it, take a few draws, and leave it once more on another stump fifty yards farther on for the next man.' <sup id="cite_ref-739" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-739">[739]</a></sup> 'For his liberality a man receives a reward of honour; but beyond that-and this should not be thought to disqualify it entirely as a virtue-he constantly looks for an equal return in kind. This is one of the striking features of primitive economics-the return of gift for gift, the maintaining of a balance. The return may be made long subsequently, but it may be called a matter of honour to equal or exceed the original gift; just as it is a matter of disgrace and lowered self-esteem to fail. There can be no question that self-display enters into the primitive virtue of liberality, and it is in respect of worldly wealth that the individual seeks most to display himself. One might almost say that the native made a virtue of wealth and that liberality was compounded of two things-mere wealth and true generosity.' <sup id="cite_ref-740" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-740">[740]</a></sup> Traditionally, slayers were entitled to special honours, such as the taking of names and the wearing of insignia, but there was no 'warrior class': 'The usual native explanation of the practice under discussion is that the name of the slain is adopted as a distinction. It draws attention to the fact that a man is embo-dari or mai-dari, i.e. a man-slayer, and marks him, therefore, as one of valour, koropahuso, ‘strong or expert with the spear’. It serves to commemorate his exploit.' <sup id="cite_ref-741" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-741">[741]</a></sup> 'There is another kind of distinction, viz. the wearing of certain ornaments, &amp;c., which may be described as homicidal insignia. To these is given the general name otohu, or the specific name of esa. The latter will be found more satisfactory here. The subject of these insignia among the Orokaiva is not so straightforward as we might expect, owing to the fact-a happy one from all points of view save the present-that homicide has long gone out of fashion, or at least no longer bears an honorific implication, so that the customs connected with it cannot be studied directly. The best written on the subject is found in the admirable article by the late W. N. Beaver in the Annual Report, 1918-19, pp. 96-9.' <sup id="cite_ref-742" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-742">[742]</a></sup> 'The source of confusion is in the fact that otohu ornaments are also given in connexion with initiation, where they certainly do not imply that the recipient has been a man-slayer. The concrete fact that they are given to girls as well as to boys or men is enough to prove this. Beaver [Page 178] made a distinction between homicidal otohu and ‘pig-otohu’, the former being conditioned by the killing of a man, the latter virtually bought with a pig. My own inquiries confirm this distinction, though I would attach more importance to the latter class than he does, and would prefer to state the matter thus, that the esa, or homicidal insignia, are a special class of otohu. The general subject of otohu will be discussed in the next chapter.' <sup id="cite_ref-743" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-743">[743]</a></sup> 'In the meantime it appears that the man-slayer, having undergone the forms of purification or exorcism, might at some convenient date receive his otohu, or, as I shall call it, qua homicidal insigne, his esa. I say ‘might’ because some of the older informants have assured me that an esa was not given invariably. Moreover, it seems that certain ornaments, which are rightly enough otohu, have been too freely regarded as esa, i.e. as implying that their possessor must be a homicide. My own inquiries have led me to believe that the variety of homicidal insignia was very limited. Beaver has given two lists, one for the coastal and central tribes and one for the Wasida and the trans-Kumusi. The first is of eight, and the second of twelve alternative ornaments or objects. (It will be understood that the River People in the north observe similar customs and use similar esa.) I do not repeat these in full, but draw attention to several of the more striking. It seems likely that Nos. 1 and 2 (the hornbill beaks and the cuscus fur) were exclusive homicidal insignia or esa proper, i.e. they could be worn only by man-slayers. But save for these two, and possibly though doubtfully for the other three mentioned with them, I am led to believe that the long list of ornaments given by Beaver, as well as many others mentioned by native informants, were presented just as readily to the peaceful initiate as to the successful warrior.' <sup id="cite_ref-744" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-744">[744]</a></sup> 'Beaver has given some interesting hints as to the symbolism of various esa. For example, the Bati-ananya symbolizes ‘the clawing hands and grinning teeth of the dead’. Again, ‘simba-a head-dress of dogs’ teeth, “sapi sapi” shells and beads, symbolical of the head smashed in by the stone club (?)’. The interrogation mark in the latter case makes it appear as if the writer did not entirely trust his informant, and while such symbolic interpretations are worth recording, we may well doubt whether they are the generally accepted interpretations, or, indeed, whether any general interpretation exists. It is not impossible that the above meanings are the extempore creations of imaginative informants reading their own meaning into the object on the spur of the moment; and I dare say that if we sought them we could discover a variety of symbolic interpretations for any one esa.' <sup id="cite_ref-745" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-745">[745]</a></sup> 'The main purpose of the esa is apparently honorific. To the Orokaiva it is, or was, an ambition to kill a man, and the man-slayer was in a manner lionized. When a warrior who already had a victim to his credit held an enemy at his mercy, he might forbear out of generosity and call on another to administer the finishing blow, and so earn the right of wearing what to an Orokaiva was perhaps the proudest possible distinction.' <sup id="cite_ref-746" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-746">[746]</a></sup> Williams describes various insignia and their bestowal: 'It is the invariable custom to call upon some old warrior of distinction to bestow these ornaments: such a man is called aguma or atemba. On this occasion at Divina Kovari there were three of them, and I shall describe their part in the ceremony at some length.' <sup id="cite_ref-747" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-747">[747]</a></sup> 'The Otohu. It remains now to say something further of the otohu. I have already referred to the homicidal otohu, or esa, in Chapter XI, and described the rites observed in the bestowal of the ordinary otohu in the present chapter. It is now our task to consider the meaning-or the various meanings-of the word. The otohu may for the present be defined as one of a number of distinctive ornaments or objects which, at a price, are ceremonially bestowed, and which the recipient is thenceforward entitled to wear or use. It will be understood that any one who was, so to speak, masquerading with an otohu would be exposed to obloquy or ridicule. In earlier days it is doubtful whether any man would have had the hardihood or folly to attempt it. Where, therefore, one sees a man holding a highly ornamented lime gourd with a shell mouth-piece, or a string bag decorated with dogs' teeth, or wearing cuscus streamers tied at intervals with bunches of feathers, it may be concluded that he has paid the price for them (or probably that the price has been paid in his behalf) and that he is fully entitled to their use.'  <sup id="cite_ref-748" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-748">[748]</a></sup> 'There is a considerable variety of these ceremonial objects, e.g. a specially ornamented bo or string bag (eti or hetava), decorated spears or stone clubs, bone forks for eating, lime-pots, belts embroidered with saima shells or made of black creeper cord, cuscus streamers, &amp;c. More commonly they take the form of ornaments (hambo) for the breast or forehead-hornbill beaks set in a half-circle, gana, huave, bono, and the like (vide p. 39). They are always fine examples of their kind, and in some cases are extremely [Page 202] ornate, with pendants and rosettes of dogs' teeth and scarlet seeds. They do not take the form of feather head-dresses, which constitute what I have throughout called the kokumbari. It will be understood, though, that the word kokumbari means literally ‘decorate’, and might correctly be applied to the otohu. A distinction is sometimes drawn between dikokumbari (bird or feather decoration) and hambo-kokumbari (ornament decoration), the latter, of course, meaning the otohu. However, I shall continue to restrict the word ‘kokumbari’ to the feather decorations which every initiate receives, and which are, as it were, cheaper than the otohu.' <sup id="cite_ref-749" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-749">[749]</a></sup> 'I have been assured that, whereas the kokumbari is given properly by the nobo, the otohu is given by the mama (not the actual father, but one of the paternal uncles); but we find that the latter rule, like the former, will not come well out of the wash. It is customary, of course, for the candidate's parents to supply the pig which is the price of the otohu. (In some cases he does so himself.) The father will bespeak the services of some other-a craftsman-to make the actual ornament, and this man (the otohu-embo) is called upon as much for his skill and artistry as for any special relationship he bears to the boy. Among twenty-one cases it appeared that the otohu-embo was mama to the candidate in nine (in one of them he was the real father), nobo in six, bitepemi in three, nabori in one, ahije (grandfather) in one, and in the last he was of no recognized relationship but merely otavo, or friend, to the candidate's father.' <sup id="cite_ref-750" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-750">[750]</a></sup> 'There is no actual social necessity for every man to receive an otohu, though it seems probable that at some time or other nearly every one does. And these further points are significant, that one person may receive a number of them at different times, and that he may receive them at any age.' <sup id="cite_ref-751" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-751">[751]</a></sup> 'The usual occasion for presenting them is at the kokumbari ceremony in which the recipients are sometimes quite young children who are still a long way from puberty. Again, as we have seen, the otohu may be given to the manslayer (though this is not absolutely invariable). But it appears further that an opportunity for bestowing an otohu might be made at any and every ceremony. Thus, for instance, [Page 203] at a dance in Petakiari, when a widow ceremonially discarded her mourning jacket of baja, or Job's Tears, she was presented with an otohu in the form of a specially decorated bo, and this with all the usual formalities.' <sup id="cite_ref-752" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-752">[752]</a></sup> 'In view of these facts we may regard the otohu as embodying a social distinction. It implies that its owner has paid a pig, or that it has been paid in his behalf, and thus the ornament has been formally and regularly acquired. Further, to the native who loves ostentation the otohu is worth having for its own sake, apart from any social distinction it may connote: it is a fine thing, for instance, to wear a ‘magnet-shaped’ shell ornament (mendo) passed through one's nose-hole and dangling somewhat awkwardly in front of one's lips, or to sit and rattle one's spatula noisily in the shell mouth-piece of an otohu lime-pot. In short the otohu has both honorific and decorative value.' <sup id="cite_ref-753" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-753">[753]</a></sup> However, these traits do not constitute a 'class system'.</dd></dl>

It draws attention to the fact that a man is embo-dari or mai-dari, i.e. a man-slayer, and marks him, therefore, as one of valour, koropahuso, ‘strong or expert with the spear’. It serves to commemorate his exploit.' <sup id="cite_ref-762" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-762">[762]</a></sup> 'There is another kind of distinction, viz. the wearing of certain ornaments, &amp;c., which may be described as homicidal insignia. To these is given the general name otohu, or the specific name of esa. The latter will be found more satisfactory here. The subject of these insignia among the Orokaiva is not so straightforward as we might expect, owing to the fact-a happy one from all points of view save the present-that homicide has long gone out of fashion, or at least no longer bears an honorific implication, so that the customs connected with it cannot be studied directly. The best written on the subject is found in the admirable article by the late W. N. Beaver in the Annual Report, 1918-19, pp. 96-9.' <sup id="cite_ref-763" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-763">[763]</a></sup> 'The source of confusion is in the fact that otohu ornaments are also given in connexion with initiation, where they certainly do not imply that the recipient has been a man-slayer. The concrete fact that they are given to girls as well as to boys or men is enough to prove this. Beaver [Page 178] made a distinction between homicidal otohu and ‘pig-otohu’, the former being conditioned by the killing of a man, the latter virtually bought with a pig. My own inquiries confirm this distinction, though I would attach more importance to the latter class than he does, and would prefer to state the matter thus, that the esa, or homicidal insignia, are a special class of otohu. The general subject of otohu will be discussed in the next chapter.' <sup id="cite_ref-764" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-764">[764]</a></sup> 'In the meantime it appears that the man-slayer, having undergone the forms of purification or exorcism, might at some convenient date receive his otohu, or, as I shall call it, qua homicidal insigne, his esa. I say ‘might’ because some of the older informants have assured me that an esa was not given invariably. Moreover, it seems that certain ornaments, which are rightly enough otohu, have been too freely regarded as esa, i.e. as implying that their possessor must be a homicide. My own inquiries have led me to believe that the variety of homicidal insignia was very limited. Beaver has given two lists, one for the coastal and central tribes and one for the Wasida and the trans-Kumusi. The first is of eight, and the second of twelve alternative ornaments or objects. (It will be understood that the River People in the north observe similar customs and use similar esa.) I do not repeat these in full, but draw attention to several of the more striking. It seems likely that Nos. 1 and 2 (the hornbill beaks and the cuscus fur) were exclusive homicidal insignia or esa proper, i.e. they could be worn only by man-slayers. But save for these two, and possibly though doubtfully for the other three mentioned with them, I am led to believe that the long list of ornaments given by Beaver, as well as many others mentioned by native informants, were presented just as readily to the peaceful initiate as to the successful warrior.' <sup id="cite_ref-765" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-765">[765]</a></sup> 'Beaver has given some interesting hints as to the symbolism of various esa. For example, the Bati-ananya symbolizes ‘the clawing hands and grinning teeth of the dead’. Again, ‘simba-a head-dress of dogs’ teeth, “sapi sapi” shells and beads, symbolical of the head smashed in by the stone club (?)’. The interrogation mark in the latter case makes it appear as if the writer did not entirely trust his informant, and while such symbolic interpretations are worth recording, we may well doubt whether they are the generally accepted interpretations, or, indeed, whether any general interpretation exists. It is not impossible that the above meanings are the extempore creations of imaginative informants reading their own meaning into the object on the spur of the moment; and I dare say that if we sought them we could discover a variety of symbolic interpretations for any one esa.' <sup id="cite_ref-766" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-766">[766]</a></sup> 'The main purpose of the esa is apparently honorific. To the Orokaiva it is, or was, an ambition to kill a man, and the man-slayer was in a manner lionized. When a warrior who already had a victim to his credit held an enemy at his mercy, he might forbear out of generosity and call on another to administer the finishing blow, and so earn the right of wearing what to an Orokaiva was perhaps the proudest possible distinction.' <sup id="cite_ref-767" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-767">[767]</a></sup> Williams describes various insignia and their bestowal: 'It is the invariable custom to call upon some old warrior of distinction to bestow these ornaments: such a man is called aguma or atemba. On this occasion at Divina Kovari there were three of them, and I shall describe their part in the ceremony at some length.' <sup id="cite_ref-768" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-768">[768]</a></sup> 'The Otohu. It remains now to say something further of the otohu. I have already referred to the homicidal otohu, or esa, in Chapter XI, and described the rites observed in the bestowal of the ordinary otohu in the present chapter. It is now our task to consider the meaning-or the various meanings-of the word. The otohu may for the present be defined as one of a number of distinctive ornaments or objects which, at a price, are ceremonially bestowed, and which the recipient is thenceforward entitled to wear or use. It will be understood that any one who was, so to speak, masquerading with an otohu would be exposed to obloquy or ridicule. In earlier days it is doubtful whether any man would have had the hardihood or folly to attempt it. Where, therefore, one sees a man holding a highly ornamented lime gourd with a shell mouth-piece, or a string bag decorated with dogs' teeth, or wearing cuscus streamers tied at intervals with bunches of feathers, it may be concluded that he has paid the price for them (or probably that the price has been paid in his behalf) and that he is fully entitled to their use.'  <sup id="cite_ref-769" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-769">[769]</a></sup> 'There is a considerable variety of these ceremonial objects, e.g. a specially ornamented bo or string bag (eti or hetava), decorated spears or stone clubs, bone forks for eating, lime-pots, belts embroidered with saima shells or made of black creeper cord, cuscus streamers, &amp;c. More commonly they take the form of ornaments (hambo) for the breast or forehead-hornbill beaks set in a half-circle, gana, huave, bono, and the like (vide p. 39). They are always fine examples of their kind, and in some cases are extremely [Page 202] ornate, with pendants and rosettes of dogs' teeth and scarlet seeds. They do not take the form of feather head-dresses, which constitute what I have throughout called the kokumbari. It will be understood, though, that the word kokumbari means literally ‘decorate’, and might correctly be applied to the otohu. A distinction is sometimes drawn between dikokumbari (bird or feather decoration) and hambo-kokumbari (ornament decoration), the latter, of course, meaning the otohu. However, I shall continue to restrict the word ‘kokumbari’ to the feather decorations which every initiate receives, and which are, as it were, cheaper than the otohu.' <sup id="cite_ref-770" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-770">[770]</a></sup> 'I have been assured that, whereas the kokumbari is given properly by the nobo, the otohu is given by the mama (not the actual father, but one of the paternal uncles); but we find that the latter rule, like the former, will not come well out of the wash. It is customary, of course, for the candidate's parents to supply the pig which is the price of the otohu. (In some cases he does so himself.) The father will bespeak the services of some other-a craftsman-to make the actual ornament, and this man (the otohu-embo) is called upon as much for his skill and artistry as for any special relationship he bears to the boy. Among twenty-one cases it appeared that the otohu-embo was mama to the candidate in nine (in one of them he was the real father), nobo in six, bitepemi in three, nabori in one, ahije (grandfather) in one, and in the last he was of no recognized relationship but merely otavo, or friend, to the candidate's father.' <sup id="cite_ref-771" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-771">[771]</a></sup> 'There is no actual social necessity for every man to receive an otohu, though it seems probable that at some time or other nearly every one does. And these further points are significant, that one person may receive a number of them at different times, and that he may receive them at any age.' <sup id="cite_ref-772" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-772">[772]</a></sup> 'The usual occasion for presenting them is at the kokumbari ceremony in which the recipients are sometimes quite young children who are still a long way from puberty. Again, as we have seen, the otohu may be given to the manslayer (though this is not absolutely invariable). But it appears further that an opportunity for bestowing an otohu might be made at any and every ceremony. Thus, for instance, [Page 203] at a dance in Petakiari, when a widow ceremonially discarded her mourning jacket of baja, or Job's Tears, she was presented with an otohu in the form of a specially decorated bo, and this with all the usual formalities.' <sup id="cite_ref-773" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-773">[773]</a></sup> 'In view of these facts we may regard the otohu as embodying a social distinction. It implies that its owner has paid a pig, or that it has been paid in his behalf, and thus the ornament has been formally and regularly acquired. Further, to the native who loves ostentation the otohu is worth having for its own sake, apart from any social distinction it may connote: it is a fine thing, for instance, to wear a ‘magnet-shaped’ shell ornament (mendo) passed through one's nose-hole and dangling somewhat awkwardly in front of one's lips, or to sit and rattle one's spatula noisily in the shell mouth-piece of an otohu lime-pot. In short the otohu has both honorific and decorative value.' <sup id="cite_ref-774" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-774">[774]</a></sup> However, there was no social class system. Accordingly, this variable may not be applicable to the Orokaiva.

<dl><dd> <b>♠ recruitment of chief executive ♣ ♥</b> Initially, political authority was confined to the informal leadership of elders and local big men: 'Political organization incorporates no central authority or hereditary leadership. Instead, it is characterized by big-men(EMBO DAMBO) and an ascendancy of elders who have proved themselves equal to the task. Such men command the respect of the village, based upon observed qualities of generosity, diligence, wealth, ability to make wise decisions, and skill in arranging ceremonial activities. This status confers no sanctioning authority, however. The Orokaiva tribes, around twelve in number, are very loose units politically and recognize no single leader. The largest unit is the tribe, which has a common territory usually demarcated from neighboring tribal territories by a belt of uninhabited land.' <sup id="cite_ref-775" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-775">[775]</a></sup> The labour and support of wives and younger men was key in the career of big men: 'Without multiple wives or a pool of single men retainers, the scope for a leader in large-scale exchange is limited. The lack of retainers attaching themselves to leaders' households could perhaps be due to the end of warfare and to improved community health so that there are now few orphans or fatherless sons. Almost every youth has a father or older brother to guarantee the payment of his brideprice. The productive relations between old men and young men are interesting in that they provide the possibility for a form of exploitation or unequal return for equal work, with the old men withholding the young men's access to a bride.' <sup id="cite_ref-776" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-776">[776]</a></sup> 'The social system is characterized by flexibility in arrangements for group membership and for transmission of rights to land. A village normally contains more than one clan branch and consequently is not necessarily a landholding unit. Residents may have closer kinship ties to residents of other villages than with some of their coresidents. Nevertheless, common residence implies some community of interest and a degree of group solidarity that is reinforced by government policy, which recognizes villages rather than descent groups as functional entities. Marriages between members of different clan branches within the village also reinforce this solidarity, which is expressed in ways such as daily food gifts, cooperation in certain tasks, and joint ceremonial activities. On the average, a lineage comprises three households. Usually, several clans are represented in a village, with members of a single clan (clan branches) being scattered among a number of neighboring villages. Lineages are more localized in cha racter, frequently being confined to a single village and tending to occupy one section of it.' <sup id="cite_ref-777" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-777">[777]</a></sup> 'There were ordinarily no persons who could command the allegiance of the tribe as a whole, nor was there any status with authority to effect the settlement of disputes between different subgroups or their individual members. Sometimes persistent intratribal conflicts led to short-term migration or to a splinter-group's secession from the tribe. However, these disturbances were very minor in comparison with the ‘flight, dispersal and migration’ in general resulting from incessant intertribal  feuds (see p. 35).' <sup id="cite_ref-778" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-778">[778]</a></sup> According to Williams, village and clan clusters occasionally formed ad hoc alliances when facing external threats: 'Williams ascribes the formation of ‘somewhat loose’ and temporary ‘confederacies of clans’, which conducted raids upon the tribe's kitoho, to a local spirit. But it is not clear whether by this he means the identification of members of a tribe with one territory or the unity of the ‘locality group’ which usually takes in a number of ‘clan-village units’ (see p.34) and which he describes as a more restricted ‘sympathy-group’ than the tribe (1930:107, 157, 163, 309-12). When he states (1925:407) that ‘over and above clan patriarchs there are recognised leaders of small clan confederacies and even - in war-time - of tribes’, he seems to equate the tribe with the district among the mountain Orokaiva (in particular Wasida and Isivita; see W.23, 124).' <sup id="cite_ref-779" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-779">[779]</a></sup> 'This combination for better defence may have been characteristic of tribes throughout the Orokaiva area. We believe, however, that the subdividing of the tribe into discrete named groups of named villages (either district or ‘hamlet group’) would be unique to the mountain Orokaiva in the culture area; we do not have enough evidence to show if this feature is related to the earlier clustering for safety, and to the greater population density in this tribe.' <sup id="cite_ref-780" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-780">[780]</a></sup> During the colonial period, British and Australian authorities superimposed their own administrative structure on the native system, installing village constables as intermediaries: 'In response to Australian pressure, the British government annexed Papua in 1888. Gold was discovered shortly thereafter, resulting in a major movement of prospectors and miners to what was then the Northern District. Relations with the Papuans were bad from the start, and there were numerous killings on both sides. The Protectorate of British New Guinea became Australian territory by the passing of the Papua Act of 1905 by the Commonwealth Government of Australia. The new administration adopted a policy of peaceful penetration, and many measures of social and economic national development were introduced. Local control was in the hands of village constables, paid servants of the Crown. Chosen by European officers, they were intermediaries between the government and the people. In 1951 an eruption occurred on Mount Lamington, completely devastating a large part of the area occupied by the Orokaiva.' <sup id="cite_ref-781" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-781">[781]</a></sup> As there was no 'nobility' among the Orokaiva, this variable may not apply to them.</dd>

<p><b>♠ occupational mobility ♣ absent ♥</b> Rural economies were dominated by subsistence horticulture: 'The household is the basic unit of production and consumption, with swidden horticulture as the subsistence base. The main crop is taro, which occupies about 90 percent of the cultivated land. A variety of other plants are grown as well, including bananas, sugarcane, edible PITPIT, and a few introduced cultigens such as pineapples, tomatoes, beans, and sweet potatoes. Although the Orokaiva traditionally tended coconut, sago, betel-nut, and a few other varieties of trees in gardens, villages, and in the bush, their arboriculture was rudimentary in comparison to their precise and detailed attention to tubers, especially taro. A good deal of plant and animal food is obtained by foraging, especially in the tropical rain forest that covers most of the Northern District. Foraged animal foods include grubs, frogs, snails, rats, and bush eggs. Foraged plant foods are valued during the dry season, when roots, leaves, and fern fronds make up part of a meal. Fish are an important resource, being used not only for consum ption but for trade. Hunting is less important; the usual quarry consists of small marsupials, birds, and pigs. Pigs, dogs, and fowl have been domesticated and each man has one or more small dogs that he uses for hunting but that are ultimately destined for the pot. Fowl are a useful source of meat, eggs, and feathers for decoration on headdresses, spears, etc. Domestic pigs are slowly disappearing from the villages, due to a government campaign to eliminate pig husbandry in an attempt to improve village hygiene.' <sup id="cite_ref-782" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-782">[782]</a></sup> 'Cooperation among men is common during hunting and house-building. Cooperation of a total village is rare, but there are cooperative hunting and fishing expeditions. There is also a sharp sexual division of labor. Men hunt; prepare tools and equipment; make sago; plant all crops, both traditional (taro, yams, sweet potatoes) and introduced (rubber, coffee); maintain the yams and rubber; harvest rubber; and market coffee. Women cook, care for the sick, maintain the taro and sweet potatoes, harvest taro, and market root crops. Men and women both fish, build fences, collect firewood, maintain and harvest the coffee crop, and market rubber.' <sup id="cite_ref-783" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-783">[783]</a></sup> 'In response to Australian pressure during the colonial period, rubber, coffee, and coconut palms for copra have been planted, providing the Orokaiva with a reliable and substantial cash income in recent years.' <sup id="cite_ref-784" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-784">[784]</a></sup> Unskilled wage labour and cash cropping were introduced during the colonial period: 'As a result of early colonial force it was men who were to be that part of the social group compelled to wage labour or to grow cash crops. This fitted well with traditional organization in which men were absent through the political demands of warfare and feasting. However, it did extend the situation so that women were called upon to do more of those daily work tasks which had been seen as the role of men. Even if the reinforcing ideology of sexual complementarity had broken down, the new outside powers did nothing legally to temper the ultimate physical superiority of the males: there was no official repression of wife beating or construction of an alternative model of marriage in law. Hence there was nothing in the law of the new power to inhibit a man's reliance on his wife or sister for much of his subsistence. While men control household money there exists the potential for greater inequality between men and women. As money can be hidden in banks it has the potential to be stored and to accumulate for a longer period than traditional items and, more importantly, can then be exchanged for almost any other item, transactions made for profit being possible within the capitalist system. As the Melpa men say (Strathern 1979:544), ‘Money is too “strong a thing” to be left to women to manage’.' <sup id="cite_ref-785" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-785">[785]</a></sup> The same is true for towns: 'The establishment of towns, unknown before the coming of Europeans, has forced an even more drastic adaptation than have the changes in rural areas. For a man to leave his village and go to work in the town means long separation from his family and from his kin, an experience unheard of in the past. Separation from his relatives means that he may be facing dangerous risks from the sorcery of foreigners in an unknown country. This is one reason why migrant workers tend to live in kin clusters in the towns. Unemployment, inadequate living quarters, low wages, the necessity for paying in cash for all goods and services, and the obligation to send cash gifts to relatives in the villages, all add to the town dwellers' difficulties.' <sup id="cite_ref-786" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-786">[786]</a></sup> 'The small urban population lives for the most part in towns whose original location was determined either by access to a good harbour for early colonial planters or, in the interior, by the availability of level land sufficient for an airstrip. Despite the greatly diminished importance of plantations and the relocation of most of these airstrips out of the towns, those origins helped determine the existing urban layout. Port Moresby and Lae, on the Huon Gulf, are the largest cities.' <sup id="cite_ref-787" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-787">[787]</a></sup> But most of the Orokaiva populaton remained rural during the colonial period. Accordingly, occupational mobility may have been absent during that time for most of the indigenous population.

Ordinances whose provisions had a particular relevance for Northern Division were those that imposed a tax and made cash cropping, carrying and roadbuilding compulsory.' <sup id="cite_ref-792" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-792">[792]</a></sup> 'In spite of lobbying from Europeans, a tax on the indigenous population was not imposed until 1918 when a £2 head tax per annum on adult males was instituted (Griffin et al. 1979:23; Wolfers 1975:34, 37; PAR 1894:v, vii, viii).' <sup id="cite_ref-793" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-793">[793]</a></sup> 'Cash cropping. The initial ordinance requiring villages to plant coconuts was passed in 1894, the intention being that the cash income would benefit the villages. Despite the fact that the planting of the communal stands was difficult to enforce and that the copra brought little cash return, by 1914 there were 10,000 planted palms in the Buna area. In 1918 the Native Plantation Ordinance set out more clearly new mechanisms of operation. In accordance with this, in 1921 the Crown started buying land for Native Plantations. Able-bodied men within 5 miles were required to work 60 days a year in lieu of tax. Failure to do so meant that they had to pay tax and, in addition, risk a fine or imprisonment. It was originally envisaged that the produce from the plantation would be divided between villagers and government but, in practice, the produce was sold and the money divided between the villagers and the government. The government's share was to be spent on works benefiting the Papuans. This part of the scheme was never fully implemented. Villagers' returns from the copra sales remained very small and occasionally they expressed their anger at this. Coffee planted under the scheme gave better returns and, by 1939, the areas planted with this cash crop around Higaturu were producing 84 tons of hulled coffee a year.' <sup id="cite_ref-794" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-794">[794]</a></sup> 'In sum then, the mechanisms of pre-war colonialism included a compulsory tax, compulsory cashcropping, compulsory carrying and roadwork.

Results for village production were periods of enforced absence of men and, presumably, an increased efficiency in men's labour due to steel axes. Women's work continued without labour-saving devices and often without the help of the men.

Monckton, as Resident Magistrate of the North-Eastern Division, writes: ‘… the Dobodura attacked and defeated the Notu, driving them from their villages and subjecting such prisoners and wounded men that fell into their hands to such fearful tortures that the Notus were panic-stricken, deserted their villages, and appealed to me for help.’  It seems probable, however, that this passage refers rather to mutilations than to an intentional infliction of pain, which, indeed, the oldest informants affirmed was never a feature of the raid.' <sup id="cite_ref-799" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-799">[799]</a></sup> 'Brought home by the raiders the corpse of the victim was set upright in the village, still attached to its pole. During the night there was dancing to the accompaniment of hui and drum-properly the largest and most old-fashioned of the drums, viz. the ino. In the morning the body was taken down to the stream and cut up in the running water, in order, as I was told, to wash away the blood. Various portions were distributed as they are in the case of a pig, and little odds and ends were given to the children, who played at roasting them in the fires.' <sup id="cite_ref-800" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-800">[800]</a></sup></dd></dl>

</p><p><b>♠ Description of the Normative Ideology ♣ ♥</b> eHRAF provides the following summary: 'The traditional beliefs of the Orokaiva, though in many respects vague and locally variable, focused primarily on the "spirits of the dead" and their influence on the living. The Orokaiva had no high god. Formerly, they were animists, believing in the existence of souls (ASISI) in humans, plants, and animals. The taro spirit was of particular importance and was the inspiration and foundation of the Taro Cult. The Orokaiva have been swept recently by a series of new cults, indicative of their religious adaptability in the face of fresh experience. Mission influence is strong in the Northern District. Religious training is provided almost exclusively by the Anglican church, although mission influence has not totally eradicated traditional beliefs, producing an air of mysticism about the resultant religious system.' <sup id="cite_ref-801" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-801">[801]</a></sup> 'Orokaiva shamans, or "taro men" serve as healers, weather magicians, and sorcerers.' <sup id="cite_ref-802" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-802">[802]</a></sup> 'Dances are held often, sometimes accompanied by music, singing, and drums. From time to time, bigmen sponsor large redistributive feasts, featuring pig sacrifices and food distribution. Activities associated with the taro cult (the "Kava Keva" cult) are the major ritual activity. The Taro Cult began about 1915 and soon evolved into ritual practices meant to placate the spirits of the dea (SOVAI) who control the taro crop. Thus, it is both a fertility cult and a cult of the dead. Taro men lead the ritual which includes choral singing, drumming, feasting, and violent shaking movements.' <sup id="cite_ref-803" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-803">[803]</a></sup>

Almost every youth has a father or older brother to guarantee the payment of his brideprice.

<dd> <b>♠ Ideological thought equates elites and commoners ♣ present ♥</b> Orokaiva society was organized in patrilineal clans rather than social classes: 'Every Orokaiva is recruited by birth into the clan of his or her father. All members of a clan claim, but cannot necessarily trace, common descent from a usually eponymous ancestor. Each clan is subdivided into named subgroups or lineages that trace their origin to a named ancestor.' <sup id="cite_ref-818" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-818">[818]</a></sup> 'Kinship terminology is of the Iroquois type.' <sup id="cite_ref-819" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-819">[819]</a></sup> Typically, multiple clans were present in one locality: 'The social system is characterized by flexibility in arrangements for group membership and for transmission of rights to land.

Instead, it is characterized by big-men(EMBO DAMBO) and an ascendancy of elders who have proved themselves equal to the task. Such men command the respect of the village, based upon observed qualities of generosity, diligence, wealth, ability to make wise decisions, and skill in arranging ceremonial activities.

The largest unit is the tribe, which has a common territory usually demarcated from neighboring tribal territories by a belt of uninhabited land.' <sup id="cite_ref-821" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-821">[821]</a></sup> 'Big men' exercised informal authority only and relied on their ability to recruit followers: 'Again all the underlings of any ‘big man’ will be known to others under his name. In the Sangara dialect there is a word tekahoka, of which I do not know the literal meaning, but which appears to stand for a ‘following’. When, at a gathering of the clans for war, or for some peaceful ceremony, [Page 104] the several parties make their appearance each following in single file behind its leader, a cry will go up, ‘Here come the people, the Tekahoka, of Embuja, of Ehari, of Andari!’-whoever the big man may be. So in the Aiga language there is a word ambotani, which embraces all a man's junior relatives; and thus a number of more or less unimportant individuals may be known to others as the juniors of a certain big man and identified by his name.' <sup id="cite_ref-822" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-822">[822]</a></sup> 'There is no well-defined chieftainship among the Orokaiva, but merely a recognized ascendancy of the old men. The leader and ruler of any clan is the eldest of its men, provided he is not so old as to be incompetent, and provided always that his personality is equal to his position. It is consequently difficult to find a word which would correspond with our idea of ‘chief’, and unsatisfactory to use the English word ‘chief’, as too pretentious for even the most important of clan leaders. The Orokaiva expressions as far as I know them are embo-be (a proper man), and embopeni, embo-pajirari, embo-paitukiari, and embo-siakabada (all of which mean no more than ‘big or important man’); and these terms may be used of men of importance who cannot claim to be actually leaders. There are two other terms, however, which seem to possess a more specific application: they are embo-javoari and embo-penjavo. The first appears to mean ‘the man who gives the name’ (javo), and the second is no doubt a contraction of embo-peni-javo (man-big-name). The implication is that the real chief is the man who gives his name to his followers, i.e. the man by whose name they are collectively known.' <sup id="cite_ref-823" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-823">[823]</a></sup> Generosity was culturally valued and also served as a major recruitment mechanism: 'Perhaps the most characteristic of them all is liberality. The liberal man is handembo, the word hande meaning distribution, or especially the sharing out of food. It is easy to understand how this should be a popular virtue, for the Orokaiva, like other natives, are much addicted to the making of feasts-and not because of a merely gluttonous appetite, as some who know least about natives have supposed, but more because of the glamour and the excitement of a social gathering. It is true we cannot acquit the handembo of a certain motive of self-display; for there is nothing, not valour in war nor prowess in the chase, that brings an Orokaiva so prominently into the public eye as the providing of a big feast. Yet no one could deny the existence of true generosity. This is shown in countless details of daily life. The paddler pauses to refresh himself with cold cooked taro; he wrenches a mouthful with his strong teeth and hands the lump without a word to the man behind him, as a boy might give his chum a bite out of the apple. Or when the carriers halt for a ‘smokeoh’ and receive their stick of tobacco, there is never one of them but has a puff or two; and when they push on again with their loads, a man will place a half-finished cigarette on a stump by the track, and another coming behind will hastily snatch it, take a few draws, and leave it once more on another stump fifty yards farther on for the next man.' <sup id="cite_ref-824" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-824">[824]</a></sup> 'For his liberality a man receives a reward of honour; but beyond that-and this should not be thought to disqualify it entirely as a virtue-he constantly looks for an equal return in kind. This is one of the striking features of primitive economics-the return of gift for gift, the maintaining of a balance. The return may be made long subsequently, but it may be called a matter of honour to equal or exceed the original gift; just as it is a matter of disgrace and lowered self-esteem to fail. There can be no question that self-display enters into the primitive virtue of liberality, and it is in respect of worldly wealth that the individual seeks most to display himself. One might almost say that the native made a virtue of wealth and that liberality was compounded of two things-mere wealth and true generosity.' <sup id="cite_ref-825" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-825">[825]</a></sup> Traditionally, slayers were entitled to special honours, such as the taking of names and the wearing of insignia, but there was no 'warrior class': 'The usual native explanation of the practice under discussion is that the name of the slain is adopted as a distinction. It draws attention to the fact that a man is embo-dari or mai-dari, i.e. a man-slayer, and marks him, therefore, as one of valour, koropahuso, ‘strong or expert with the spear’. It serves to commemorate his exploit.' <sup id="cite_ref-826" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-826">[826]</a></sup> 'There is another kind of distinction, viz. the wearing of certain ornaments, &amp;c., which may be described as homicidal insignia. To these is given the general name otohu, or the specific name of esa. The latter will be found more satisfactory here. The subject of these insignia among the Orokaiva is not so straightforward as we might expect, owing to the fact-a happy one from all points of view save the present-that homicide has long gone out of fashion, or at least no longer bears an honorific implication, so that the customs connected with it cannot be studied directly. The best written on the subject is found in the admirable article by the late W. N. Beaver in the Annual Report, 1918-19, pp. 96-9.' <sup id="cite_ref-827" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-827">[827]</a></sup> 'The source of confusion is in the fact that otohu ornaments are also given in connexion with initiation, where they certainly do not imply that the recipient has been a man-slayer. The concrete fact that they are given to girls as well as to boys or men is enough to prove this. Beaver [Page 178] made a distinction between homicidal otohu and ‘pig-otohu’, the former being conditioned by the killing of a man, the latter virtually bought with a pig. My own inquiries confirm this distinction, though I would attach more importance to the latter class than he does, and would prefer to state the matter thus, that the esa, or homicidal insignia, are a special class of otohu. The general subject of otohu will be discussed in the next chapter.' <sup id="cite_ref-828" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-828">[828]</a></sup> 'In the meantime it appears that the man-slayer, having undergone the forms of purification or exorcism, might at some convenient date receive his otohu, or, as I shall call it, qua homicidal insigne, his esa. I say ‘might’ because some of the older informants have assured me that an esa was not given invariably. Moreover, it seems that certain ornaments, which are rightly enough otohu, have been too freely regarded as esa, i.e. as implying that their possessor must be a homicide. My own inquiries have led me to believe that the variety of homicidal insignia was very limited. Beaver has given two lists, one for the coastal and central tribes and one for the Wasida and the trans-Kumusi. The first is of eight, and the second of twelve alternative ornaments or objects. (It will be understood that the River People in the north observe similar customs and use similar esa.) I do not repeat these in full, but draw attention to several of the more striking. It seems likely that Nos. 1 and 2 (the hornbill beaks and the cuscus fur) were exclusive homicidal insignia or esa proper, i.e. they could be worn only by man-slayers. But save for these two, and possibly though doubtfully for the other three mentioned with them, I am led to believe that the long list of ornaments given by Beaver, as well as many others mentioned by native informants, were presented just as readily to the peaceful initiate as to the successful warrior.' <sup id="cite_ref-829" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-829">[829]</a></sup> 'Beaver has given some interesting hints as to the symbolism of various esa. For example, the Bati-ananya symbolizes ‘the clawing hands and grinning teeth of the dead’. Again, ‘simba-a head-dress of dogs’ teeth, “sapi sapi” shells and beads, symbolical of the head smashed in by the stone club (?)’. The interrogation mark in the latter case makes it appear as if the writer did not entirely trust his informant, and while such symbolic interpretations are worth recording, we may well doubt whether they are the generally accepted interpretations, or, indeed, whether any general interpretation exists. It is not impossible that the above meanings are the extempore creations of imaginative informants reading their own meaning into the object on the spur of the moment; and I dare say that if we sought them we could discover a variety of symbolic interpretations for any one esa.' <sup id="cite_ref-830" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-830">[830]</a></sup> 'The main purpose of the esa is apparently honorific. To the Orokaiva it is, or was, an ambition to kill a man, and the man-slayer was in a manner lionized. When a warrior who already had a victim to his credit held an enemy at his mercy, he might forbear out of generosity and call on another to administer the finishing blow, and so earn the right of wearing what to an Orokaiva was perhaps the proudest possible distinction.' <sup id="cite_ref-831" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-831">[831]</a></sup> Williams describes various insignia and their bestowal: 'It is the invariable custom to call upon some old warrior of distinction to bestow these ornaments: such a man is called aguma or atemba. On this occasion at Divina Kovari there were three of them, and I shall describe their part in the ceremony at some length.' <sup id="cite_ref-832" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-832">[832]</a></sup> 'The Otohu. It remains now to say something further of the otohu. I have already referred to the homicidal otohu, or esa, in Chapter XI, and described the rites observed in the bestowal of the ordinary otohu in the present chapter. It is now our task to consider the meaning-or the various meanings-of the word. The otohu may for the present be defined as one of a number of distinctive ornaments or objects which, at a price, are ceremonially bestowed, and which the recipient is thenceforward entitled to wear or use. It will be understood that any one who was, so to speak, masquerading with an otohu would be exposed to obloquy or ridicule. In earlier days it is doubtful whether any man would have had the hardihood or folly to attempt it. Where, therefore, one sees a man holding a highly ornamented lime gourd with a shell mouth-piece, or a string bag decorated with dogs' teeth, or wearing cuscus streamers tied at intervals with bunches of feathers, it may be concluded that he has paid the price for them (or probably that the price has been paid in his behalf) and that he is fully entitled to their use.'  <sup id="cite_ref-833" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-833">[833]</a></sup> 'There is a considerable variety of these ceremonial objects, e.g. a specially ornamented bo or string bag (eti or hetava), decorated spears or stone clubs, bone forks for eating, lime-pots, belts embroidered with saima shells or made of black creeper cord, cuscus streamers, &amp;c. More commonly they take the form of ornaments (hambo) for the breast or forehead-hornbill beaks set in a half-circle, gana, huave, bono, and the like (vide p. 39). They are always fine examples of their kind, and in some cases are extremely [Page 202] ornate, with pendants and rosettes of dogs' teeth and scarlet seeds. They do not take the form of feather head-dresses, which constitute what I have throughout called the kokumbari. It will be understood, though, that the word kokumbari means literally ‘decorate’, and might correctly be applied to the otohu. A distinction is sometimes drawn between dikokumbari (bird or feather decoration) and hambo-kokumbari (ornament decoration), the latter, of course, meaning the otohu. However, I shall continue to restrict the word ‘kokumbari’ to the feather decorations which every initiate receives, and which are, as it were, cheaper than the otohu.' <sup id="cite_ref-834" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-834">[834]</a></sup> 'I have been assured that, whereas the kokumbari is given properly by the nobo, the otohu is given by the mama (not the actual father, but one of the paternal uncles); but we find that the latter rule, like the former, will not come well out of the wash. It is customary, of course, for the candidate's parents to supply the pig which is the price of the otohu. (In some cases he does so himself.) The father will bespeak the services of some other-a craftsman-to make the actual ornament, and this man (the otohu-embo) is called upon as much for his skill and artistry as for any special relationship he bears to the boy. Among twenty-one cases it appeared that the otohu-embo was mama to the candidate in nine (in one of them he was the real father), nobo in six, bitepemi in three, nabori in one, ahije (grandfather) in one, and in the last he was of no recognized relationship but merely otavo, or friend, to the candidate's father.' <sup id="cite_ref-835" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-835">[835]</a></sup> 'There is no actual social necessity for every man to receive an otohu, though it seems probable that at some time or other nearly every one does. And these further points are significant, that one person may receive a number of them at different times, and that he may receive them at any age.' <sup id="cite_ref-836" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-836">[836]</a></sup> 'The usual occasion for presenting them is at the kokumbari ceremony in which the recipients are sometimes quite young children who are still a long way from puberty. Again, as we have seen, the otohu may be given to the manslayer (though this is not absolutely invariable). But it appears further that an opportunity for bestowing an otohu might be made at any and every ceremony. Thus, for instance, [Page 203] at a dance in Petakiari, when a widow ceremonially discarded her mourning jacket of baja, or Job's Tears, she was presented with an otohu in the form of a specially decorated bo, and this with all the usual formalities.' <sup id="cite_ref-837" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-837">[837]</a></sup> 'In view of these facts we may regard the otohu as embodying a social distinction. It implies that its owner has paid a pig, or that it has been paid in his behalf, and thus the ornament has been formally and regularly acquired. Further, to the native who loves ostentation the otohu is worth having for its own sake, apart from any social distinction it may connote: it is a fine thing, for instance, to wear a ‘magnet-shaped’ shell ornament (mendo) passed through one's nose-hole and dangling somewhat awkwardly in front of one's lips, or to sit and rattle one's spatula noisily in the shell mouth-piece of an otohu lime-pot. In short the otohu has both honorific and decorative value.' <sup id="cite_ref-838" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-838">[838]</a></sup> However, these traits do not constitute a 'class system' as Orokaiva society was generally egalitarian.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Ideological thought equates all ethnicities ♣ absent ♥</b> Non-Orokaiva 'outsider wives' were often treated with suspicion and had trouble integrating into the community: 'The ‘outsider’ wife, from beyond traditional affinal links, faces more specific problems when living with her husband in his village. Her initial lack of ability to grow and harvest subsistence crops different from those of her own area is a major cause for her husband's annoyance. Her inability to speak Orokaivan and her cultural difference makes acceptance and support from other village wives slower to develop. She is too far away from home to call on the support of her male relatives when in trouble. For instance, while I was in the field a woman from Madang was beaten and burnt by her husband on two separate occasions. Although Koropata wives would go to her aid in the morning, only two youths from another clan made a token visit, wishing to show some concern and aware that the woman was well away from the determent of male kin. Wives from distant provinces pined for their own families and lamented the great cost of fares to visit home, beyond anything they could save from market sales.' <sup id="cite_ref-839" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-839">[839]</a></sup> 'I noted only two cases of an outside wife being installed in the village without her husband. Such women were criticized for not understanding the traditional subsistence techniques of the area, for being lazy, and for failing to behave properly at feasts. In one case a woman from the Gulf Province was sent to live with the household of her husband's brother. She had with her a female relative. At special dinners they were not included in the meal, eating separately at the back of the room. At one feast distribution the young wife, seemingly tired of being snubbed, threw down the small share given to her and brought down the wrath of the host family. In the evenings, speeches were made in the special parable form known to the older people, making reference to the laziness and ignorance of the two Gulf women. They were social isolates, communicating with few people and excluded from comprehending the Orokaivan conversations around.' <sup id="cite_ref-840" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-840">[840]</a></sup> However, this appears to be due to prejudice rather than an explicit difference of 'legal' rights. There was no explicit 'ethnic' stratification among the native population. But the native population found itself at the bottom of an imperial interethnic hierarchy once colonial administrators and European settlers had established themselves: 'There is currently some covert aggression towards the European settlers, some of whom reciprocate in a more overt manner. The history of European contact has not always been happy. Frequent misunderstanding and misinterpretation by both sides has led to strained social relations in many cases. The initial settlement of Europeans in the area resulted in bloodshed and ill-feeling. Early miners and police both had cause to fear the Orokaiva. Later government attempts to enforce cash cropping met strong resistance in some areas. The Japanese invasion and its subsequent defeat led to many confusing and bewildering Orokaiva deaths. Since the last war there has been some improvement of the race relations - but they are still basically seen in some type of dominance relationship, e.g., master - labourer, teacher - pupil, etc. The Anglican church has ordained a few priests and in general has congenial relations with the Orokaiva, yet this does not necessarily suggest a closer empathy with or understanding of the people. The Orokaiva regard some resident Europeans as welcome and fairly warmly received and others as being unwelcome trespassers. More Europeans appear to be in the latter category than is generally realized.' <sup id="cite_ref-841" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-841">[841]</a></sup> 'Like any enclave in a foreign country the European settlers attribute stereotyped characteristics of personality and temperament to particular local groups. This process of one group classifying another into psychological types provides a working basis for interaction. The Orokaiva were quickly allotted a stereotype and this came to be reinforced as the ascribed characteristics were searched for and found. The Orokaiva were classed as being ‘surly’, ‘resentful’, ‘sulking’, ‘good policemen but need [Page 7] to be kept under control’. Europeans now living in the Northern District tend to make such wide generalizations. They also tend to allot unique stereotypes to subgroups such as villages or tribes.' <sup id="cite_ref-842" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-842">[842]</a></sup> The code reflects the Orokaiva situation rather than the colonial system. Given how 'foreign' wives were treated differently from Orokaiva women, we have assumed that different 'ethnicities' or cultural groups were not considered equals, or at least not equally valuable or trustworthy.</dd>

Cooperation of a total village is rare, but there are cooperative hunting and fishing expeditions. There is also a sharp sexual division of labor. Men hunt; prepare tools and equipment; make sago; plant all crops, both traditional (taro, yams, sweet potatoes) and introduced (rubber, coffee); maintain the yams and rubber; harvest rubber; and market coffee. Women cook, care for the sick, maintain the taro and sweet potatoes, harvest taro, and market root crops. Men and women both fish, build fences, collect firewood, maintain and harvest the coffee crop, and market rubber.' <sup id="cite_ref-843" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-843">[843]</a></sup> Polygyny was relatively uncommon: 'Polygamy is relatively uncommon. In most of the instances which have come under my notice the wives manage to get on successfully enough with one another, though it is frequently said to be otherwise. I know of one man who ‘threw away’ his first wife because she could not live in [Page 93] amity with his second; of a second wife who, after a quarrel with the first, poisoned herself with derris or ‘New Guinea Dynamite’; and of a husband, formerly a village constable, who was so upset by the wrangling of his two wives as to go away and hang himself. But these instances once more are exceptional, and the polygamous household may be said as a rule to be a peaceful one. Very commonly each wife occupies a separate house, and invariably she works a garden area of her own, so that mutual independence does much to prevent friction.' <sup id="cite_ref-844" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-844">[844]</a></sup> According to Williams, women did not play 'public' or political roles but were not oppressed either: 'The Position of Women. The wife and mother is largely occupied with matters of ménage, and takes little part in wider social activities. Completely overshadowed by the male she seems very well satisfied with her relative unimportance. A woman takes no initiative in matters which concern the clan as a whole, though, when a number of clans are together at a festival and feeling is perhaps strained, she is sometimes known to blow upon the coals. She has a weapon, the poreha or quarterstaff, and in former times would sometimes accompany cannibal raids, acting the part of armour-bearer or assisting in the commissariat.' <sup id="cite_ref-845" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-845">[845]</a></sup>  'To sum up on the social position of woman we may say that she is nominally and often actually under the control of her husband, but that by virtue of his restraint on the one hand and her powers of personal expression on the other, the married couple usually get on very well together as a working unit. In public life, i.e. in the affairs of clan and village, the woman takes only a small part, but is well contented to have it so. She works longer hours than her husband, but her share of labour is not entirely disproportionate; indeed, the popular belief that women do all the work in a native village while their men-folk sprawl about in idleness is quite mistaken. A fairly systematic investigation in two Aiga villages howed that of a total potential working time, men were idle 50 per cent. and women 33 per cent. On the whole it may be safely said that the position of Orokaiva women-indeed of native women in general-is not so slave-like and degraded as popular sentiment imagines.' <sup id="cite_ref-846" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-846">[846]</a></sup> Women's ceremonial roles complemented those of men: 'Some interesting points concerning female roles emerge from the foregoing discussion. In many presentations a woman received gifts according to her status as a member of the clan of her birth or of the clan of her marriage. Thus Cecil's father's sister played a dominant role in the giving of pigs and cows (see Tables 5.5 and 5.8). Women played the most emotional roles in the ritual immediately following death, releasing tension and grief by unrestrained wailing and physical collapse. Their grief was also expressed in the more organized dance of the Mothers' Union. They had a rare opportunity to create their own song and movements. Throughout the funeral, as on other social occasions, women's activities are [Page 159] for the most part separate from, though complementary to, those of the men. In this most important life crisis, however, women, in particular older women, appear to have more autonomy in their actions. They take the initiative in both decision-making and in creativity relating to the exchanges and the mourning surrounding the death.' <sup id="cite_ref-847" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-847">[847]</a></sup> However, women assisted their husbands in warfare and could also incite violence: 'It was customary for women to accompany the expedition carrying pots of food; and they might even stand by their husbands as armour-bearers. Sir William MacGregor, ascending the Kumusi in 1894, noted that ‘The men carried generally a spear and a shield each, with a woman behind him bearing two or three spears. The women were able-bodied, and unaccompanied by children or small boys. Apparently they were simply armour-bearers.’ Again, on the same river in 1895 he met many armed natives, ‘the warrior being frequently followed by a woman carrying part of his panoply, or ready to relieve him of his arms when he was induced to dispense with them.’ The women were always ready to urge on the fighting men and even to mingle in the fray, as W. E. Armit found when in conflict with the natives of Papangi. For then, when the warriors rushed to the attack among the long grass, cheered on by the shrill cries, ‘Cheep! Cheep! Cheep!’, of their women-folk, it was found when they were finally beaten off that two of the women lay dead with spears in their hands.' <sup id="cite_ref-848" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-848">[848]</a></sup> 'The significance of warfare to Orokaivan men is obvious but several descriptions suggest that Orokaivan women were also directly involved. Women had their own weapon, a quarterstaff ‘poreha’ (Williams 1930:163) and on at least one occasion joined in with the men in spear fighting. On most occasions it seems that women used only their staffs and fought alongside men in aggressive sham fights between clans (Waiko 1972, Williams 1930:162-163). They were more noted for their verbal contribution. The people most difficult to pacify were women, who, while doing little actual violence with their … quarterstaffs, were very successfully inciting to violence with their tongues (Williams 1930:163). If a man receives homicidal insignia without having killed, women “jeered at him and cried ‘I think you are a weakling; here's my dress, you'd better wear it’” (Beaver 1920:99). A widow must stay secluded until the capture and killing of a man from the tribe that killed her husband (Williams 1930:170). Hence, in the face of battle, in the training of young men, and in the deprivations suffered by a widow, there is female pressure towards male revenge and homicide. On the more practical level, women often accompanied men on long intertribal raids carrying pots of food and acting as armour bearers during battle (Williams 1930:164; P.A.R. 1892-3:34, 1895-6:29). However the most important fighting roles fell upon the men and there is no doubt that fighting withdrew them from the labour force on more occasions and for longer periods than it did the women.' <sup id="cite_ref-849" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-849">[849]</a></sup> However, women were denied some insignia: 'The posthumous honour of a bahari is denied to a woman for a curious reason which I have heard several times repeated. Women are too fond of bivije or adulterous intercourse, and are therefore undeserving of the dignity of an elevated position. They are laid on a mat on the ground, and the only real regret for them is said to be on the part of those who have enjoyed their favours. And since these latter are ashamed to weep for fear of betraying themselves, the woman goes unwept and unhonoured to her grave. This explanation, needless to say, was derived from male informants, and, in point of fact, the demonstrations of grief at a woman's death are hardly less extravagant than at a man's.' <sup id="cite_ref-850" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-850">[850]</a></sup> It appears that women could not become 'big men' (see also institutional variables).</dd>

<p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of inequality ♣ absent ♥</b> Orokaiva society was fairly egalitarian (see above).
</p><p><b>♠ Ideological reinforcement of monogamy ♣ present ♥</b> eHRAF provides a general description of the marriage and kinship systems: 'Every Orokaiva is recruited by birth into the clan of his or her father. All members of a clan claim, but cannot necessarily trace, common descent from a usually eponymous ancestor. Each clan is subdivided into named subgroups or lineages that trace their origin to a named ancestor.' <sup id="cite_ref-851" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-851">[851]</a></sup> 'Kinship terminology is of the Iroquois type.' <sup id="cite_ref-852" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-852">[852]</a></sup> 'Polygyny among the Orokaiva is accepted but rare. Clan exogamy is preferred, but not strictly enforced. Villages are not exogamous. A large bride-price is required for arranged marriages, although in the past wives were also obtained through capture. Postmarital residence is ideally patrilocal, but in practice people have a wide choice between the villages of patrilateral or matrilateral kin or of affines, and residence may be changed at any time. The distribution of clan branches through a number of villages is closely related to access to the group's land, hence the initial motivation for a long-term change in residence may be influenced by proximity to land intended to be brought into cultivation. Divorce is allowed, with custody of minor children going to the father, except for infants.' <sup id="cite_ref-853" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-853">[853]</a></sup> 'The basic domestic and economic unit is the household, composed of either a nuclear or extended family.' <sup id="cite_ref-854" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-854">[854]</a></sup> Clan membership was patrilineal: 'The Control of Children. Children become members of the father's clan and naturally assume his clan emblem. They thus belong essentially to the father rather than to the mother. In cases of divorce, for example, it is normal for the child to remain in the custody of the father, unless it be an infant at the breast, when the matter may be waived, though compensation is due to the husband. The case of orphans is similar. Although there appears to be no formal adoption they are cared for in the normal case by the people of their father, being regarded indeed as their property.' <sup id="cite_ref-855" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-855">[855]</a></sup> Traditionally, marriages were concluded through purchase, exchange, elopement or capture: 'THE customs relating to marriage will be better understood if it be made clear at the outset that there are four distinct methods by which an Orokaiva can obtain a wife. They are (1) Purchase, (2) Exchange, (3) Elopement, and (4) Capture. The first three of these methods are in continual use to-day; the fourth has fallen out of fashion, but only since the pacification of the country by the white man. Cases of marriage by capture have been very common, and the custom is not so long obsolete but that many women are still to be found in the Division who first met their husbands as members of a hostile raiding party. I shall return to a discussion of these several methods at the end of the chapter.' <sup id="cite_ref-856" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-856">[856]</a></sup> Accordingly, both arranged marriages and elopment were practiced: 'Courtship. Young children are sometimes betrothed by their parents. This transaction is called kerari, and from the beginning the boy's father will make continual presents of food to the girl's people, by which he lays them under an obligation. The kerari, while perfectly regular, is relatively uncommon. Witnesses have said that it invariably implies an exchange, i.e. the adult parties to the transaction each have both a boy and a girl at their disposal. Consequently the gifts of food are in the ordinary instance reciprocal. The kerari betrothal will probably reach a happy ending in marriage, but it is always subject to a sudden alteration when a pubescent girl or boy begins to show wayward preferences. It is said that a parent will urge his daughter to marry the boy she is pledged to without undue delay, for fear she should take a fancy to some other and let her father down by decamping.' <sup id="cite_ref-857" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-857">[857]</a></sup> 'One is happy to say, however, that courtship usually takes a more romantic form than that of child betrothal. There is a word with a somewhat intriguing sound, viz. kigi, which implies clandestine meetings and love-making in the bush. A boy will go to where he knows a girl is at work in [Page 134] the garden, and hiding himself in the bush nearby, will break a dry twig in his fingers, so as to make just enough noise to attract her private attention. The word kigi would seem to apply specifically to this trick. Another way is to make the noise between lips and teeth which by ourselves is commonly associated with kissing, but which bears no such implication to the Orokaiva girl at work in the garden, as she is ignorant of this kind of blandishment. Again, in a man's betava I have seen an article called bohiva which resembles a seed-pod but which is really a receptacle made by an insect for holding and hatching its eggs. It is dry and empty, and when pressed makes a clicking noise like a ping-pong ball. It is used expressly for kigi, and a little girl of eight or nine was covered with the prettiest confusion when the bohiva was pressed before her.' <sup id="cite_ref-858" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-858">[858]</a></sup> 'Sometimes, as we shall see, a youth and girl elope, and in that event we may assume that their previous meetings and love-makings are mostly in secret. But when there is no likely objection to the marriage, he will visit her from time to time by night in her father's house. He knows exactly where to find her, and as the matter has been prearranged he is not likely to meet with a rebuff. There is no actual prohibition against sexual intercourse before marriage, but it is nevertheless regarded as the proper thing for the young couple to abstain. It may seem unlikely that they do abstain, but nevertheless it has been so frequently and consistently asserted that the boy and his sweetheart sleep ‘for nothing’ that one must believe that the statement is at least partly true. It is quite unlikely that young men, when they realize that their questioner has nothing censorious in his attitude, should endeavour to conceal from him what they know is a matter of indifference. I am therefore convinced that there is some truth in the constant assertion of my informants that a great deal of the love-making, even the ‘sleeping together’, is, as we should call it, innocent.' <sup id="cite_ref-859" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-859">[859]</a></sup> Newton claims that marriages concluded through kin relations and brideprice arrangements were more stable: 'Marriages contracted without kin involvement and/or a brideprice could be more prone to dissolution. The long-term results of village elopements are more likely to be modified by brideprice demand. A reasonable brideprice demand encourages a permanent marriage and an unreasonably high brideprice demand tends to dissolve the partnership. The marriages are also less likely to be susceptible to breakdown once both sides of the family have an interest in maintaining the exchange relationships established by the brideprice payment.' <sup id="cite_ref-860" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-860">[860]</a></sup> Married partners were entitled to each other's land and labour: 'As against these male and female obligations, we may note some clearcut rights: the man's right to his wife's labour and the wife's equally important right of unlimited access to the husband's garden land and to its produce. This right extends not only to harvesting food for the household, but also for gifts she may choose to make outside the household, providing that she manages the food supply so as to avoid shortages. A domestic dispute I observed in Sivepe (referred to in Chapter III above) illustrates the importance attached to this married woman's right. When this dispute was adjudicated, the ‘explanation’ of the breakdown of the marriage was found in a single incident, namely the husband's instruction to his wife not to go to his garden again. Here, in the view of everyone present, lay the ‘root’ of the trouble, a judgment with which the husband was willing to agree. This prohibition to go to his garden is one of the few things a husband is on no account to utter to his wife; it amounts to total repudiation of the conjugal relationship.' <sup id="cite_ref-861" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-861">[861]</a></sup> Polygyny was present but uncommon as most marriages were monogamous: 'Polygamy is relatively uncommon. In most of the instances which have come under my notice the wives manage to get on successfully enough with one another, though it is frequently said to be otherwise. I know of one man who ‘threw away’ his first wife because she could not live in [Page 93] amity with his second; of a second wife who, after a quarrel with the first, poisoned herself with derris or ‘New Guinea Dynamite’; and of a husband, formerly a village constable, who was so upset by the wrangling of his two wives as to go away and hang himself. But these instances once more are exceptional, and the polygamous household may be said as a rule to be a peaceful one. Very commonly each wife occupies a separate house, and invariably she works a garden area of her own, so that mutual independence does much to prevent friction.' <sup id="cite_ref-862" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-862">[862]</a></sup> 'In the great majority of instances marriage is monogamous. Whether in the fighting days there existed that surplus of males over females which the modern census reveals, it is impossible to say; but apart from this we are told that every mature and normal man had a wife, so that one finds it difficult to conceive how polygamy could have been very prevalent. In present-day instances the polygamous husband rarely has more than two wives. A certain young man Orari of Isivita, who is of more than usually prepossessing appearance, has divorced one and at present owns three. Asked why he had so many he said it was the girls' fault; they all wanted him. It seems probable, however, that wealth and power rather than personal attraction are the means of winning extra wives. The record instance, as far as my knowledge goes, is that of a man Buninia whose wives are numbered by his surviving contemporaries at eleven. Buninia was a man of great influence among all the Aiga clans, and was notorious for bad temper and bullying. It is said that he was greatly feared. It will go without [Page 131] saying that he was wealthy. I do not know which of these attributes had the greatest influence in winning him eleven wives.' <sup id="cite_ref-863" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-863">[863]</a></sup> The data on exogamy are ambiguous: 'The evidence regarding exogamy is not entirely consistent. Some witnesses have said it is not permissible for a man to marry a woman of his own clan. For this two arguments have been put forward, but neither throws much light on the matter. If a girl married a man of her own clan, where, it was asked, would the pay or bride-price come from? On another occasion a witness said that if a man and wife of the same clan happened to quarrel they would both find themselves calling the name of the same heratu or plant emblem; and the neighbours overhearing would shake their heads or turn up their noses at the idea of marriage between two of the same clan. Other informants have expressed repugnance at the suggestion of marriage with a du or ‘sister’, so that it would appear that in general theory at least the clan should be exogamous. As for the village group (in which there may be several clans), it cannot be called exogamous even in theory. It has been stated, on the contrary, that in a village where there happens to be a number of attractive girls it is a wise thing for the young men of that village to marry them and keep them at home. And this precept was made applicable to the clan itself by some informants; for the rule of clan exogamy was actually in some cases denied.' <sup id="cite_ref-864" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-864">[864]</a></sup> 'When we consult the facts we find that marriage is usually outside the clan, but that the exceptions are numerous enough to prove that clan exogamy is not a hard and fast rule. It also appears that marriage is usually outside the [Page 132] village, though the exceptions are just as numerous. The most notable example came from the Aiga village Ehenada (a large and rambling one, it is true), where of twelve men questioned, all of whom belonged to Ehenada and the clan Asiahije, no less than five had married women of the same village and the same clan. Again in two neighbouring villages of the Simborota clan I found five inter-marriages.' <sup id="cite_ref-865" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-865">[865]</a></sup> 'Marriage is common between first cousins, though in no recorded instance did these cousins belong to one and the same clan. We may probably assume that the marriage of first cousins within the clan is forbidden, although the general rule of clan exogamy is often disregarded. There is no rule against marrying out of one's generation, and I have several cases of marriage between a man and his iai, or daughter in the classificatory sense.' <sup id="cite_ref-866" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-866">[866]</a></sup>

Such co-operation is seen especially in the earlier stages of gardening, in fencing, in sago-making, and in the hunting or fishing expedition; and the point that claims our attention is that among those who are expected to participate in such undertakings there are commonly no defaulters. I have asked often enough what would happen to a hypothetical defaulter, but such questions seldom meet with a satisfactory answer because one's informants seem almost unable to visualize an unusual situation. It is answered simply that all the able-bodied who should take part will take part; nor can I recall any concrete case of a man deliberately shirking his duty in any major enterprise of the group. This willingness to co-operate or assist is a sufficiently striking native trait which we may call simply helpfulness. It is seen most strongly perhaps in war or in minor quarrels, where the native is always too ready to take up the cudgels in behalf of his people or his friend: it is the active aspect of clannishness. One of the reasons why a village is sometimes almost depleted of its young men because they all elect to ‘sign-on’ for labour in a batch is simply this desire to stand by one another. ‘What will happen to our brother’, they say, ‘when he is set upon by a mob of stalwart Kiwais, if we are not there to help him?’ But in all the incidents of daily life the same spirit of helpfulness is apparent: a man is lost, and there is a great turn-out to find him; if he is ill or in distress he is never neglected; if he cries ‘Help!’ there is an excited [Page 319] rushing to the scene. On the whole we may say that the Orokaiva seldom fails in this duty of helping the members of his group.' <sup id="cite_ref-869" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-869">[869]</a></sup> 'Sometimes the whole clan will co-operate. This is seen especially when a move is made and work begun on a new area. Sometimes by invitation another village will come to assist in these initial operations. This is the nearest approach that the Orokaiva makes to the African working bee. Passing at noon through the village of Ohoraburari-so named because the ‘dance of the rooster’ was once performed there-we see the women already busy, and a great array of black pots on the fires. A little farther and we come to the new garden clearing, where we find at work the whole population, men and women, of a neighbouring village, Totoimaburari, ‘the dance of Totoima’, the legendary mankiller. Working with them are a few of the Ohoraburari people-such as are not more interested in helping prepare the feast for their paying guests.' <sup id="cite_ref-870" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-870">[870]</a></sup> 'Clearing of bushland is often a community affair, with the lineage and sometimes the whole sub-clan co-operating, but planting is organised by individual households, with some reciprocal assistance from other households for specific tasks at irregular intervals.' <sup id="cite_ref-871" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-871">[871]</a></sup> 'Kinship groups are of major importance in the functioning of village society in New Guinea. Every individual is a member not only of a parish but also of groups of closer kin, a clan, and maybe a lineage. Lacking any system of payment in cash for services rendered, the villager obtains the assistance of his relatives for heavy work such as the felling of big trees to make a swidden, dragging a canoe log to the beach, or making a long seine fishing net. Obligations thus incurred are met either by reciprocating when asked or by making a gift. The kinship group provides social stability and in practice the pattern of land use is frequently decided by the senior members of the group. The planting of food crops by any member, even on land to which he does not control cultivation rights, causes no concern because rights to temporary usage may be easily granted, but the planting of tree crops, which may remain in the ground from thirty to eighty years, is a different matter. Planting tree crops is tantamount to alienating the land for at least a generation and very often some members, at least, of the kinship group object to such long-term use. Even if they do agree to an individual member planting tree crops, there is almost always the assumption that he must share any profit he makes with other members of the group. Individuals who have planted cash crops under these conditions generally become discouraged when they see the fruits of their labours being reaped by kinsmen who contribute little or nothing towards production.' <sup id="cite_ref-872" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-872">[872]</a></sup> 'Each clan controls some areas of mature rain forest, some of secondary forest, and some of grassland. Only the secondary forest is regarded as valuable garden land. The mature rain forest is potential garden land of the future, and grassland is unimportant, except for hunting. Clan land-holdings are fragmented within the confines of Yega territory. This pattern can be explained partly by the social system of land use and partly by the history of Yega expansion inland from the coast. The members of different lineages belonging to the same clan normally combine to clear areas of rain forest by communal labour. When the work is completed the land is divided among the lineages which helped clear it. This is the origin of the pattern of large continuous strips of land belonging to one clan, but sub-divided amongst the sub-clans and lineages of that clan as shown in Fig. 3. The commonly elongated shape of clan holdings is the result of continuous clearing in one direction by a group of kinsmen talking and joking as they worked and thus keeping close together. The small enclaves of land shown within the general Kurou clan area but belonging to other clans (Fig. 3) may be explained by affinal relationships. At various times the Kurou men cutting down the forest gave permission to some men of other clans, who had married Kurou women, to work with them. These affinal kinsmen thus acquired cultivation rights to small pieces of land, which have been inherited by their descendents. The first areas cleared were close to the coast; as population increased and more land was required, the inland forests were cut down in the manner described above.' <sup id="cite_ref-873" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-873">[873]</a></sup> But this does not seem to constitute charity according to our own definition.

<dd><b>♠ communal dining ♣ present ♥</b> Until the early colonial period, Orokaiva groups celebrated the return of warriors after successful raids with a feast: 'When the victorious raiders returned they announced their success from afar off by a distinctive rhythm on the hui which (according to Aiga informants) may be represented thus:__ __ _ __, __ __ _ __ __.' <sup id="cite_ref-874" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-874">[874]</a></sup>//'There were conventional songs proper to the occasion, such as (an Aiga example), Eruga tune kambaja-one Eruga [leaf   seasoning] Isuga tune   Kambaja-one Isuga [leaf   seasoning] by which the women were given to understand that they should prepare ‘cabbage’ for the cooking; or (a Sangara example) Umo tihue kiari-ta koiko-ta, which indicated that the enemy had fled (koiko), anxious to see (kiari) the familiar place where they drew water (umo [Page 172] tihu). The men who had not themselves secured victims would sing (another Sangara example), U sina nane arako, u sina nane, ‘Mine was like a water-fight’, by which they meant that they had fought as ineffectually as children bathing and splashing one another with water.' <sup id="cite_ref-875" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-875">[875]</a></sup>//'Brought home by the raiders the corpse of the victim was set upright in the village, still attached to its pole. During the night there was dancing to the accompaniment of hui and drum-properly the largest and most old-fashioned of the drums, viz. the ino. In the morning the body was taken down to the stream and cut up in the running water, in order, as I was told, to wash away the blood. Various portions were distributed as they are in the case of a pig, and little odds and ends were given to the children, who played at roasting them in the fires. It was formerly the custom, I understand, to set up skulls of victims on a gaga or small platform in the village, just as pig-jaws are to be seen nowadays ranged along a branch of an old croton scrub. The pig-jaws are mainly in the nature of trophies, though it is said that to throw them away and lose sight of them would have an ill effect on hunting thereafter. I cannot say what were the motives for keeping human skulls, but presumably the same reasons would hold good.' <sup id="cite_ref-876" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-876">[876]</a></sup> Big Men sponsored pig sacrifices and feasts in order to affirm mutual obligations and alliances. Pig Feasts and Sacrifices confirmed obligations through acts of generosity: 'Perhaps the most characteristic of them all is liberality. The liberal man is handembo, the word hande meaning distribution, or especially the sharing out of food. It is easy to understand how this should be a popular virtue, for the Orokaiva, like other natives, are much addicted to the making of feasts-and not because of a merely gluttonous appetite, as some who know least about natives have supposed, but more because of the glamour and the excitement of a social gathering. It is true we cannot acquit the handembo of a certain motive of self-display; for there is nothing, not valour in war nor prowess in the chase, that brings an Orokaiva so prominently into the public eye as the providing of a big feast.' <sup id="cite_ref-877" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-877">[877]</a></sup>//Feasts could be very costly and required a long period of preparation: 'There is little to say concerning the harvesting. A woman gathers from time to time enough for her family's immediate wants, and the taro tops will be replanted. There are thus a number of plots at different stages of advancement in every woman's garden. Sometimes, however, when all the gardens of a clan are well stocked, there will be a simultaneous harvesting to furnish forth a feast. The products of the garden are then loaded ostentatiously upon platforms in the village before their final distribution to the guests.' <sup id="cite_ref-878" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-878">[878]</a></sup>//Schwimmer reports the construction of feast-houses: 'The house in which the parents floated away must be understood as the prototype of the feast house. This is a small structure placed at one end of the central plaza (araha) of a village. It is built a few weeks before the feast and it is in front of and in the feast house that rituals are performed during the whole of the period that ceremonies last. We may take it that Jomiko and Sirere are [Page 54] demigods who are believed to have stablished the institution of building a feast house. As this couple were in the feast house during the fight, it may be assumed that they were, in a ritual sense, the feast-givers. A modern feast also always has a person occupying the office of feast leader who is charged with the ritual as well as the organisational tasks of the feast. This leader (pondo kiari embo) is a man acting alone, and there is no mention that his wife has any function. This is a curious discrepancy between myth and custom, especially as elsewhere in New Guinea the feast-givers are often an elderly couple (e.g. Landtman 1927).' <sup id="cite_ref-879" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-879">[879]</a></sup>//Large feasts featured pig sacrifices: 'The pig is carried in the usual manner, with its feet bound to a pole. For a long journey a pig-litter (kakate) may be used. It is a cage-like structure of cane which, as it were, is made to measure and fits closely about the animal's body (see p. 79). The conventional method of slaughtering is with the spear, and at a feast of importance this is done ceremonially, a number of pigs being set in a row and stuck simultaneously. On such an occasion I have seen one of the butchers, more elderly than the rest, fail to impart sufficient force to his thrust, and try again, amid a good deal of laughter, until he drove the point home. Then he levered the shaft of his weapon back and forth like a crow-bar to make his work the surer. On the whole, however, there is no special inhumanity in the treatment of pigs.' <sup id="cite_ref-880" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-880">[880]</a></sup> 'The actual butchering is performed on a platform. Two long incisions are made from shoulder to tail, and the skin cut off together with a thick coating of fat. Then the body is dismembered with axe, trade knife, and bamboo knife (the last-named, ivi, is still used because of its extraordinary sharpness). The carving is not a pleasing spectacle. The blood drips through between the rails of the platform and is eagerly lapped up by quarrelling dogs below. There may [Page 62] be some delay in the distribution of the meat, and then the scene of the feast becomes a veritable shambles. There is little squeamishness with the native, however, and even the entrails are not despised. As it was explained (whether naïvely or waggishly) on one occasion, fresh entrails are suitable for men; if they stink a little they are suitable for women; and if they stink a great deal they will do for the children.' <sup id="cite_ref-881" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-881">[881]</a></sup> 'The pig sacrifice at this meeting serves to remove any latent hostility between the men of the group, so that all will be united and co-operate unreservedly towards the success of the feast. Though the pondo kiari embo tends to be a man of much influence in the village, he does not normally have any authority over resources held by any extended family other than his own. It is only for the specific purpose of feast-giving that he is given such authority, and it is limited in time from the meeting just described until the day of the feast itself. The meeting thus temporarily changes the authority structure of the village. The growing taro crop and the available pigs become, at least ideally, the corporate property of the village, whereas normally they are family property. The pondo kiari embo becomes, at least formally and ritually, the controller of this property. The unit of the group of offerers of the sacrifice is a necessary condition for the success of the rituals that follow.' <sup id="cite_ref-882" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-882">[882]</a></sup>//Feasts featured the formal redistribution of food among hosts and guests: 'Towards the end of the day comes the formal distribution of food. The master of the feast, conferring anxiously with his friends, has been setting out the taro in heaps, making them correspond by laborious arithmetic with the number of his principal guests. Now that the tally appears satisfactory, he turns, with an enthusiasm bordering on violence, to the distribution. With loud shouts he and his assistants rush back and forth depositing, or often rather hurling down, bunches of taro before the guests, who accept them with a fitting appearance of indifference. In the same way the pig flesh-legs, quarters, chines, and entrails-are bestowed on top of the taro heaps, and the guests are ready to depart. They have been sufficiently regaled throughout the day; the food thus finally distributed is to be carried home. The women pack it into their string bags and prepare to move off. Men and children will bear their part. One remembers the spectacle of a diminutive child bearing away the blood-spattered head of a huge pig, balanced with difficulty and pride upon his own small crown. Thus laden with proofs of friendship the guests depart to await the time when, in a year or so, they will make a similar return of hospitality.' <sup id="cite_ref-883" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-883">[883]</a></sup>//Feasts were held on multiple occasions: 'In pre-European times, according to present-day informants, the most important feasts held by the Orokaiva people were associated with initiation, marriage, death (though apparently not birth), and the enhancement of prestige. Feasts were also held to mark the transfer of land, the re-establishment of peace between persons who had been quarrelling, resumption of residence after a prolonged absence, and the lifting of prohibitions between a man and his mother-in-law.' <sup id="cite_ref-884" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-884">[884]</a></sup>//There may have been considerable change in the scale and types of feasts celebrated in the colonial period: 'It is impossible to know with any certainty the scale of feasting prior to European contact for, though a detailed study of these people was made in the late 1920s (Williams 1928 and 1930). Government patrols had brought tribal fighting to a halt some years before. It is therefore quite likely that, with less time taken up in warfare and greater freedom of movement assured, the feasts and ceremonies of that day were more elaborate than those of the precontact era.' <sup id="cite_ref-885" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-885">[885]</a></sup>//Williams reports ritualized declarations of loyalty, but also claims that underlying wariness between guests and hosts was common: 'Again all the underlings of any ‘big man’ will be known to others under his name. In the Sangara dialect there is a word tekahoka, of which I do not know the literal meaning, but which appears to stand for a ‘following’. When, at a gathering of the clans for war, or for some peaceful ceremony, [Page 104] the several parties make their appearance each following in single file behind its leader, a cry will go up, ‘Here come the people, the Tekahoka, of Embuja, of Ehari, of Andari!’-whoever the big man may be. So in the Aiga language there is a word ambotani, which embraces all a man's junior relatives; and thus a number of more or less unimportant individuals may be known to others as the juniors of a certain big man and identified by his name.' <sup id="cite_ref-886" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-886">[886]</a></sup> 'Treachery, of which one or two examples have been given (pp. 166-7), was not regarded as contemptible, and according to Beaver, as we have seen, one kind of homicidal emblem was specially assigned to the slayer of a peace emissary. Towards all outsiders the correct attitude was one of suspicion if not always of hostility; a complete stranger wandering alone would be regarded both as potential enemy and good meat; and when visitors came in friendship, as at a feast, there was never any lack of warlike readiness on either side. The very cries of welcome which are so characteristic of the Orokaiva are possibly a sign of the dormant hostility between guest and host, being recognizable in one case at least as meant for reassurance of the former regarding the intentions of the latter.' <sup id="cite_ref-887" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-887">[887]</a></sup></dd>

<p><b>Supernatural beings (e.g., gods, spirits, ancestors)</b>
</p>
<dl><dd><b>♠ Number of officially sanctioned supernatural beings ♣ polytheistic ♥</b> ‘Demigods’ and ancestral spirits were thought to inhabit Mt Lamington, an active volcano, and wander the countryside, occasionally causing misfortune among humans. "Ritual prohibitions limited access to the area close to the crater as there was a belief that Sumbiripa, if disturbed, would be angry. There was also a great fear of the dead who were supposedly dwelling in the mountain. It is believed that the dead wander about the countryside, where they may attack humans. Sumbiripa is dangerous, even if he does not erupt, because he can send out his ghosts to cause misfortune among men. The myth about Sumbiripa Kanekari hints at the possibility of an earlier eruption by the account it gives of the origin of the crags existing before 1951.'<sup id="cite_ref-942" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-942">[942]</a></sup> There were also plenty of Taro spirits: 'There were spirits of all the multifarious kinds of the taro plant, Kaiva, Porove, Kivere, Ovivi, &amp;c., and not only of the taro but of other garden plants as well. It is too much to expect cut-and-dried dogma from natives, and there is confusion and haziness as to the nature and numbers of these plant spirits. There are probably at least a score of varieties of the taro cultivated by the Orokaiva, all of them readily distinguished by differences of leaf, stalk, or bulb. The taro spirits bear the names of these several varieties, but, according to the truly orthodox view propounded in the head-quarters of the cult, there are countless spirits for every variety. They join in disembodied forgatherings at the Ba nyasi, or Taro villages, Siri, Waiegi, Kome, and Duero-to name some of them-which are wooded hills along the picturesque coast between Deboi and Ambasi. They throng invisibly at the feasts in the real villages. As I was once talking with the Taro man Yaviripa (a rare opportunist in debate) he informed me that a taro spirit was close by us at the moment. He had met the spirit in a dream last night, and had been apprised of its intention to join the discussion; now a twitching in his shoulder told him that the appointment had been kept.'<sup id="cite_ref-943" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-943">[943]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ Omnipresent supernatural beings ♣ inferred absent ♥</b> Inferred from the fact that, when they first encountered Christian missionaries, the Orokaiva were skeptical of the claim of the Christian God's omnipotence. 'The Orokaiva attitude to Christianity is a complex subject which I intend to treat more fully elsewhere and falls somewhat outside the concern of our present project. It is very clear that some basic notion of Christian monotheism have not been accepted by the Orokaiva, such as for instance the notion of God's omnipotence. Orokaiva Christians believe in the existence of God and in His infinite power, but He is viewed as an addition to other powers, Who is hostile to some of these other powers, but not necessarily to others. I was told that a person ought to give up black magic after baptism, but informants dismissed my suggestion that Christianity was also opposed to curing magic. No curing magician ever ceased practising when he was baptised.'<sup id="cite_ref-944" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-944">[944]</a></sup> It seems reasonable to infer that they were skeptical of the Christian God's omnipresence as well.</dd>

<dd><b>♠ High Gods (creator gods) ♣ absent ♥</b> The Orokaiva appear not to have had "high gods": 'Apart from the very faint hint which these last may give us there is nothing to suggest a deity or any supernatural being of independent existence, least of all a high-god. I do not know of any cosmogony, and there is no attribution of divine powers to the phenomena of nature. On the whole it will be found that Orokaiva religion concerns itself primarily with the spirits of the dead.'<sup id="cite_ref-946" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-946">[946]</a></sup> However, they did have demi-gods, who they believed to be the source of moral principles: 'Orokaiva social philosophy differs from our own, in the first place by its refusal to recognise the authority of anyone outside the individual's extended family, a characteristic to which I shall give more attention later. If the Orokaiva, by and large, order their lives by the same moral principles, they would explain this by their common belief in certain demigods whom they all regard as their ancestors and as sources of authority, and who created certain institutions embodying moral norms to which they all subscribe. Not only do they obey the precepts of these demi-gods, they also re-enact their feats in ritual and identify with them during ceremonies, and in many of their regular expressive activities.'<sup id="cite_ref-947" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-947">[947]</a></sup> 'I shall therefore attempt to reconstruct what these demi-gods are said to have taught the Orokaiva about social relations. This reconstruction requires a brief analysis of some myths in which these teachings are contained. The myths all refer to events in original time. I was told that men, in their primordial or pre-cultural state, were living by the top of Mount Lamington (Sumbiripa Kanekari), which is traditionally regarded by the Orokaiva as the centre of the universe (Schwimmer 1969). I collected a number of myths explaining the origin of death, strife, fire, houses, marriage, clothing and several other elements of culture. The demigods who transformed human life by introducing these gifts came ‘from the mountain’; Sumbiripa himself was the first man to die. He retired inside the mountain and all those who died later are said to stay with him inside the mountain. Hence the rumblings and tremors emitted by the volcano. Two published sources (Tomlin 1951, Benson 1955) show that these beliefs antedate the eruption of 1951.'<sup id="cite_ref-948" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-948">[948]</a></sup> Having said this, no evidence could be found that these demi-gods (or any other supernatural being) punished or rewarded mortals on the basis of moral principles: there were ritual prohibitions against going near certain volcanic craters, lest the demi-god Sumbiripa became angry, and spirits living in the countryside were believed to occasionally attack people, but the "reason" for Sumbiripa's anger and the spirits' attack seem to stem more from transgressions against the gods than against other humans, or perhaps simply these beings' unpredictable nature. "Ritual prohibitions limited access to the area close to the crater as there was a belief that Sumbiripa, if disturbed, would be angry. There was also a great fear of the dead who were supposedly dwelling in the mountain. It is believed that the dead wander about the countryside, where they may attack humans. Sumbiripa is dangerous, even if he does not erupt, because he can send out his ghosts to cause misfortune among men. The myth about Sumbiripa Kanekari hints at the possibility of an earlier eruption by the account it gives of the origin of the crags existing before 1951.'<sup id="cite_ref-949" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-949">[949]</a></sup> The separation between the human and 'wild' worlds was also important: 'The separation of man and pig leads immediately to the division of the world [Page 141] into two separate realms: the human world, comprising villages and gardens, and the wild world, ariri, the bush, where everything is dangerous and inimical to man, and where the ghosts (sovai) have their abode.

It is very clear that some basic notion of Christian monotheism have not been accepted by the Orokaiva, such as for instance the notion of God's omnipotence. Orokaiva Christians believe in the existence of God and in His infinite power, but He is viewed as an addition to other powers, Who is hostile to some of these other powers, but not necessarily to others.

'(1) The commonest is papara or ese, the frond of coco-nut palm tied about the butt, which means that no one is to [Page 324] climb for nuts. (2) The heri is a strip of bark or a liana tied to uprights and encircling a house or some forbidden ground. (3) A harihari is some object, usually leaf or twig, placed in the cleft of a split stick and set up, e.g., at the mouth of a creek as a sign of a fishing right. (4) Inja is simply a few handfuls of grass laid across a track to bar the passage. We might include (5) the naterari and pamba (p. 226), which serve to mark a village tabu on the coco-nuts, and (6) logically enough the ordinary garden boundary, tani, which consists merely of a series of tree-trunks or branches laid on the ground between adjacent plots. These are all regarded quite strictly: no man would step over an inja or take a short cut across an area enclosed by a heri. Less regular marks which may serve as reminders for some casual rule are observed with equal stringency. For instance, I have seen an eight of diamonds wedged in a split stick and set up in a village to forbid the playing of cards; it had been erected by a man of influence who has somehow acquired conscientious scruples regarding the forbidden game. The sanctions for the strict observance of these marks will be discussed presently; the signs themselves are described here merely to show the existence of tangible safeguards, principally, but not always, of the law of property.'<sup id="cite_ref-968" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-968">[968]</a></sup></dd>

"Ritual prohibitions limited access to the area close to the crater as there was a belief that Sumbiripa, if disturbed, would be angry. There was also a great fear of the dead who were supposedly dwelling in the mountain. It is believed that the dead wander about the countryside, where they may attack humans. Sumbiripa is dangerous, even if he does not erupt, because he can send out his ghosts to cause misfortune among men.

He must not drink pure water out of the river, but only that which has been stirred up and made muddy by the feet of a non-slayer. He must not eat taro cooked in the pot, but only that which has been roasted in the open fire. He must abstain from sexual intercourse. These restrictions lasted for a few days and then the slayer ate the same purificatory stew (suna) which is given to initiates at the end of their seclusion (see p. 193). Among the Binandele I witnessed a mock demonstration of a peculiar rite which immediately preceded the eating of the suna. The slayer climbs into a small tree which contains a nest of those large and aggressive insects commonly called ‘green’ ants. The tree should properly be of the kind called Bobo, which [Page 175] is always swarming with them. While he crouches in a fork of the tree, branches are broken and laid over him so that he is almost completely covered and thoroughly bitten. Having endured this for some time, he climbs down and eats the suna, steaming himself over the dish and sponging his joints with handfuls of the stewed leaves.

The taboos which are incumbent upon the professing Taro man will call for further description.

Auja, the red pandanus seed, and sasaru, a kind of frog, are tabooed for the same reason.

If the Orokaiva, by and large, order their lives by the same moral principles, they would explain this by their common belief in certain demigods whom they all regard as their ancestors and as sources of authority, and who created certain institutions embodying moral norms to which they all subscribe.

Williams writes that husbands were expected not to bet their wives 'overmuch' and not to assault other men: 'There is a word igege (Binandele yege) which may be translated ‘moral law’, or perhaps, since the examples are all negative, ‘moral prohibition’. The examples were such as the following: not to steal a man's vegetables, canoes, spears, &amp;c.; not to usurp his fishing rights; not to take his dog to hunt, but to drive it back if it followed the hunter of its own accord; not to commit adultery; not to beat one's wife overmuch; not to commit assault on another man. These igege were for adults; they did not apply to children, who had to be treated with so much indulgence; still less to dogs, whose nature it was to steal on sight. While not implying standardization, the mere existence of the word hints at a definite conception of right and wrong.' <sup id="cite_ref-1008" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1008">[1,008]</a></sup> More material is needed.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ fairness/cheating ♣ suspected unknown ♥</b> According to Williams, fairness was not valued in relation to outsiders: 'Treachery, of which one or two examples have been given (pp. 166-7), was not regarded as contemptible, and according to Beaver, as we have seen, one kind of homicidal emblem was specially assigned to the slayer of a peace emissary. Towards all outsiders the correct attitude was one of suspicion if not always of hostility; a complete stranger wandering alone would be regarded both as potential enemy and good meat; and when visitors came in friendship, as at a feast, there was never any lack of warlike readiness on either side. The very cries of welcome which are so characteristic of the Orokaiva are possibly a sign of the dormant hostility between guest and host, being recognizable in one case at least as meant for reassurance of the former regarding the intentions of the latter.' <sup id="cite_ref-1009" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1009">[1,009]</a></sup> But material on fairness norms within the in-group is needed before the variable can be coded.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ in-group loyalty ♣ present ♥</b> The in-group largely coincided with the kin group. According to eHRAF, Orokaiva society was organized in patrilineal clans: 'Every Orokaiva is recruited by birth into the clan of his or her father. All members of a clan claim, but cannot necessarily trace, common descent from a usually eponymous ancestor. Each clan is subdivided into named subgroups or lineages that trace their origin to a named ancestor.' <sup id="cite_ref-1010" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1010">[1,010]</a></sup> 'Kinship terminology is of the Iroquois type.' <sup id="cite_ref-1011" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1011">[1,011]</a></sup> Williams confirms this: 'The Orokaiva are divided into a number of large tribes which may be named at this point. The classification rests mainly on a basis of language and follows, with a little amplification, the list made by Chinnery and Beaver. It must [Page 6] be understood, however, that the present is a very rough-and-ready statement of the case; for there is far more blending and complexity than appears in a bare list of nine tribes. A fuller treatment of the classification of tribes will be given in Chapter X; in the meantime the principal of them are: 1. Binandele and Jeva Buje. 2. Tain-Daware. 3. Aiga. 4. Yega. 5. Sauaha. 6. Sangara. 7. Dirou. 8. Wasida. 9. Hunjara. Their disposition may be seen on the map.' <sup id="cite_ref-1012" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1012">[1,012]</a></sup> 'The native roughly classifies these tribes according to their environment. The River People are called Umo-ke, lit. ‘water-language’; they comprise the Binandele of the Mambare and Gira rivers and the large branch of the same tribe called Jeva Buje, inhabiting the lower Kumusi. The coastal Tain-Daware and Yega are called Eva-Embo, ‘Salt-water Men’, and the inland tribes are collectively known as Autembo, ‘Bushmen’, or more often as Pereho (Berepo), a word which has the same general meaning, or more specifically stands for the ‘little bush-pigs’ that are captured wild in the forest. There are naturally some environmental differences between these large groups, but it appears that such differences are not essential. There seems to be no good ground other than group-conceit for the opinion of an Aiga that the Bush People were momoseja, attractive and ‘pretty’ (the same word would be applied to a brilliant croton leaf), while the River People were kamoseja, ugly and unattractive, with black skins like Kiwais, ringworm, and elephantiasis.' <sup id="cite_ref-1013" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1013">[1,013]</a></sup> 'The Control of Children. Children become members of the father's clan and naturally assume his clan emblem. They thus belong essentially to the father rather than to the mother. In cases of divorce, for example, it is normal for the child to remain in the custody of the father, unless it be an infant at the breast, when the matter may be waived, though compensation is due to the husband. The case of orphans is similar. Although there appears to be no formal adoption they are cared for in the normal case by the people of their father, being regarded indeed as their property.' <sup id="cite_ref-1014" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1014">[1,014]</a></sup> Generally, multiple lineages were represented at a locality: 'The social system is characterized by flexibility in arrangements for group membership and for transmission of rights to land. A village normally contains more than one clan branch and consequently is not necessarily a landholding unit. Residents may have closer kinship ties to residents of other villages than with some of their coresidents. Nevertheless, common residence implies some community of interest and a degree of group solidarity that is reinforced by government policy, which recognizes villages rather than descent groups as functional entities. Marriages between members of different clan branches within the village also reinforce this solidarity, which is expressed in ways such as daily food gifts, cooperation in certain tasks, and joint ceremonial activities. On the average, a lineage comprises three households. Usually, several clans are represented in a village, with members of a single clan (clan branches) being scattered among a number of neighboring villages. Lineages are more localized in cha racter, frequently being confined to a single village and tending to occupy one section of it.' <sup id="cite_ref-1015" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1015">[1,015]</a></sup> Kin relations organized mutual aid and cooperation: 'Kinship groups are of major importance in the functioning of village society in New Guinea. Every individual is a member not only of a parish but also of groups of closer kin, a clan, and maybe a lineage. Lacking any system of payment in cash for services rendered, the villager obtains the assistance of his relatives for heavy work such as the felling of big trees to make a swidden, dragging a canoe log to the beach, or making a long seine fishing net. Obligations thus incurred are met either by reciprocating when asked or by making a gift. The kinship group provides social stability and in practice the pattern of land use is frequently decided by the senior members of the group. The planting of food crops by any member, even on land to which he does not control cultivation rights, causes no concern because rights to temporary usage may be easily granted, but the planting of tree crops, which may remain in the ground from thirty to eighty years, is a different matter. Planting tree crops is tantamount to alienating the land for at least a generation and very often some members, at least, of the kinship group object to such long-term use. Even if they do agree to an individual member planting tree crops, there is almost always the assumption that he must share any profit he makes with other members of the group. Individuals who have planted cash crops under these conditions generally become discouraged when they see the fruits of their labours being reaped by kinsmen who contribute little or nothing towards production.' <sup id="cite_ref-1016" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1016">[1,016]</a></sup> 'Each clan controls some areas of mature rain forest, some of secondary forest, and some of grassland. Only the secondary forest is regarded as valuable garden land. The mature rain forest is potential garden land of the future, and grassland is unimportant, except for hunting. Clan land-holdings are fragmented within the confines of Yega territory. This pattern can be explained partly by the social system of land use and partly by the history of Yega expansion inland from the coast. The members of different lineages belonging to the same clan normally combine to clear areas of rain forest by communal labour. When the work is completed the land is divided among the lineages which helped clear it. This is the origin of the pattern of large continuous strips of land belonging to one clan, but sub-divided amongst the sub-clans and lineages of that clan as shown in Fig. 3. The commonly elongated shape of clan holdings is the result of continuous clearing in one direction by a group of kinsmen talking and joking as they worked and thus keeping close together. The small enclaves of land shown within the general Kurou clan area but belonging to other clans (Fig. 3) may be explained by affinal relationships. At various times the Kurou men cutting down the forest gave permission to some men of other clans, who had married Kurou women, to work with them. These affinal kinsmen thus acquired cultivation rights to small pieces of land, which have been inherited by their descendents. The first areas cleared were close to the coast; as population increased and more land was required, the inland forests were cut down in the manner described above.' <sup id="cite_ref-1017" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1017">[1,017]</a></sup> Clans held land: 'Before we can fully understand the system of using the land, it is necessary to describe the system under which it is owned. Among the Orokaiva there is a multiplicity of small clans, which from time to time increases by subdivision (a process which is in part neutralized by the dying out of older clans). Now the land is owned in reality by the clan. The fact that very commonly the clan is a local unity, being often coincident with the single village, makes this system a simple one in the normal instance. Sometimes, however, the clan is somewhat [Page 125] scattered, occupying several villages or parts of several villages. In this case the clan will in all probability retain a nominal ownership of all its lands; but in practice it is customary for the various sections to assume by general consent or else by the allocation of a headman, the occupation and usage of particular parts of the land. In due time the section is likely to adopt a distinctive name, and to develop into an independent clan: the right of usage tacitly becomes ownership, and we find the normal condition restored, viz. the clan locally unified and in possession of its own tracts of land. A system exactly similar governs the ownership of the small waterways (useful for fishing) and of the sago swamps.' <sup id="cite_ref-1018" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1018">[1,018]</a></sup> Individuals retained ties with maternal kin: 'The maternal uncle (nobo) has no real authority over the child, and his ceremonial obligations towards it are somewhat vague. However, there exists a cordial relationship between the two, and the nobo is treated with respect as a relative of importance. It is worth remarking that an Orokaiva child, while belonging to the people of its father, is very ready to identify itself also with those of its mother. When living with the latter and helping the maternal uncle in his work the child feels itself to belong for the time being to the maternal clan. At such a time it will use the maternal plant emblem, and indeed at all times it will name that emblem as subsidiary to the one it inherits from its father. In short, where the child, who belongs indisputably to its father's clan, is still on such friendly and intimate footing with its mother's, we might say that the system, although patrilineal in theory, was almost bilateral in effect.' <sup id="cite_ref-1019" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1019">[1,019]</a></sup> Fission was common and the system was therefore somewhat flexible. This was also how new clans originated: 'Although the clan is a fairly well-defined group, it is difficult to find a satisfactory native name for it in the abstract. Among the Aiga the nearest approach seems to be the expression embo-javo, lit. ‘man-name’; but this might stand in another context for the man's personal name. Among the Binandele there is a more definite term oro-be, ‘the true oro’ (the usual meaning of oro is men's house). In the Sangara dialect a word araha stands for either a village clearing or a clan. In the absence of a suitable native name I shall continue to use the word ‘clan’.' <sup id="cite_ref-1020" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1020">[1,020]</a></sup> 'The Formation of New Clans. The Orokaiva clan is patriarchal in constitution; it develops directly from the family in which the father is undisputed master.

Such a case is probably an elementary one, and the clan of comparatively recent origin. I will suggest a reason for this state of affairs and for the origin of the clans in general. There is an evident tendency for small family units to split off from the main body and form independent settlements. The reason is sometimes a quarrel and the fear of retaliatory magic, but more often, I believe, it is simply the lax method of horticulture which necessitates the clearing of many areas in succession and sometimes a temporary settlement on a distant site. This distant site is planted with coco-nut and betel, and, when subsequently the garden is again made on or about the same spot, it becomes the temporary home of a small settlement. But now one or two men may establish themselves here permanently with their families. So long as they retain their original clan name the settlement can only be regarded as an offshoot; but when they wax in numbers and begin to be known by a separate name, they become ipso facto a separate clan.' <sup id="cite_ref-1024" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1024">[1,024]</a></sup> 'This process goes on continually. It means that originally the clan occupies a single village (a fact which is hinted at by the dual meaning of araha). In the hamlet of Borugata, for example, there are three houses and a combined yam-house and shelter. The head of the village is one Pipire, a man of middle age, who has three wives and thirteen children (an unusually large quiverful for an Orokaiva). The wife and son of his deceased brother are the only other occupants of the village. This small village of Borugata is an offshoot from another, Tandeti, inhabited by the clan Anjaha. As yet Pipire and his children retain the clan name of Anjaha; but it will be seen that we have the makings of a new clan, and it is only necessary for this small and essentially [Page 103] patriarchal group to receive a distinctive name for it to become a separate clan.' <sup id="cite_ref-1025" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1025">[1,025]</a></sup> 'While in origin the clan and the village are co-extensive, this state of affairs is by no means always maintained.

<dd><b>♠ respect for authority ♣ absent ♥</b> Orokaiva society was organized in patrilineal clans rather than social classes or castes: 'Every Orokaiva is recruited by birth into the clan of his or her father.

But, as so often in the case of such rules, we find on looking into the matter that other relatives may equally well perform the function. Thus in the present instance I recorded more cases where the kokumbari was given by the paternal uncle than where it was given by the maternal uncle. In other cases, again, it was given by the elder brother. On the whole, however, it may be regarded as proper for the nobo to give the kokumbari, as I have also heard that it is proper for him to attend to the initiate during his seclusion. But neither of these rules is observed with strictness.' <sup id="cite_ref-1031" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1031">[1,031]</a></sup> The relationship with in-laws was regulated through taboos: 'In passing I may mention a point of some interest. Among the Orokaiva there are certain strict rules of etiquette between relatives by marriage (particularly between the man and his parents-in-law), exemplified by a very strict name-avoidance. Now, although a man will cut down his own heratu tree without mercy, he will hesitate to do the same with a tree that happens to bear the name of his atovo or imboti, i.e. his father-in-law or his mother-in-law, and may request one of his companions in the clearing to fell this particular tree for him. Similarly he will not eat any food, animal or vegetable, which happens to be synonymous with either of his parents-in-law. Now this rule is based on sentiment; there are, as far as my knowledge goes, no magico-religious sanctions to it; and where a similar tabu is observed with regard to the heratu we may probably assume that this is likewise no more than a sentimental avoidance.' <sup id="cite_ref-1032" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1032">[1,032]</a></sup> Leadership was informal: 'Political organization incorporates no central authority or hereditary leadership. Instead, it is characterized by big-men(EMBO DAMBO) and an ascendancy of elders who have proved themselves equal to the task. Such men command the respect of the village, based upon observed qualities of generosity, diligence, wealth, ability to make wise decisions, and skill in arranging ceremonial activities. This status confers no sanctioning authority, however. The Orokaiva tribes, around twelve in number, are very loose units politically and recognize no single leader. The largest unit is the tribe, which has a common territory usually demarcated from neighboring tribal territories by a belt of uninhabited land.' <sup id="cite_ref-1033" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1033">[1,033]</a></sup> Big men were prominent: 'Again all the underlings of any ‘big man’ will be known to others under his name. In the Sangara dialect there is a word tekahoka, of which I do not know the literal meaning, but which appears to stand for a ‘following’. When, at a gathering of the clans for war, or for some peaceful ceremony, [Page 104] the several parties make their appearance each following in single file behind its leader, a cry will go up, ‘Here come the people, the Tekahoka, of Embuja, of Ehari, of Andari!’-whoever the big man may be. So in the Aiga language there is a word ambotani, which embraces all a man's junior relatives; and thus a number of more or less unimportant individuals may be known to others as the juniors of a certain big man and identified by his name.' <sup id="cite_ref-1034" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1034">[1,034]</a></sup> 'There is no well-defined chieftainship among the Orokaiva, but merely a recognized ascendancy of the old men. The leader and ruler of any clan is the eldest of its men, provided he is not so old as to be incompetent, and provided always that his personality is equal to his position. It is consequently difficult to find a word which would correspond with our idea of ‘chief’, and unsatisfactory to use the English word ‘chief’, as too pretentious for even the most important of clan leaders. The Orokaiva expressions as far as I know them are embo-be (a proper man), and embopeni, embo-pajirari, embo-paitukiari, and embo-siakabada (all of which mean no more than ‘big or important man’); and these terms may be used of men of importance who cannot claim to be actually leaders. There are two other terms, however, which seem to possess a more specific application: they are embo-javoari and embo-penjavo. The first appears to mean ‘the man who gives the name’ (javo), and the second is no doubt a contraction of embo-peni-javo (man-big-name). The implication is that the real chief is the man who gives his name to his followers, i.e. the man by whose name they are collectively known.' <sup id="cite_ref-1035" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1035">[1,035]</a></sup> Generosity was valued: 'Perhaps the most characteristic of them all is liberality. The liberal man is handembo, the word hande meaning distribution, or especially the sharing out of food. It is easy to understand how this should be a popular virtue, for the Orokaiva, like other natives, are much addicted to the making of feasts-and not because of a merely gluttonous appetite, as some who know least about natives have supposed, but more because of the glamour and the excitement of a social gathering. It is true we cannot acquit the handembo of a certain motive of self-display; for there is nothing, not valour in war nor prowess in the chase, that brings an Orokaiva so prominently into the public eye as the providing of a big feast. Yet no one could deny the existence of true generosity. This is shown in countless details of daily life. The paddler pauses to refresh himself with cold cooked taro; he wrenches a mouthful with his strong teeth and hands the lump without a word to the man behind him, as a boy might give his chum a bite out of the apple. Or when the carriers halt for a ‘smokeoh’ and receive their stick of tobacco, there is never one of them but has a puff or two; and when they push on again with their loads, a man will place a half-finished cigarette on a stump by the track, and another coming behind will hastily snatch it, take a few draws, and leave it once more on another stump fifty yards farther on for the next man.' <sup id="cite_ref-1036" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1036">[1,036]</a></sup> 'For his liberality a man receives a reward of honour; but beyond that-and this should not be thought to disqualify it entirely as a virtue-he constantly looks for an equal return in kind. This is one of the striking features of primitive economics-the return of gift for gift, the maintaining of a balance. The return may be made long subsequently, but it may be called a matter of honour to equal or exceed the original gift; just as it is a matter of disgrace and lowered self-esteem to fail. There can be no question that self-display enters into the primitive virtue of liberality, and it is in respect of worldly wealth that the individual seeks most to display himself. One might almost say that the native made a virtue of wealth and that liberality was compounded of two things-mere wealth and true generosity.' <sup id="cite_ref-1037" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1037">[1,037]</a></sup> Special insignia were awarded to slayers, initiands and accomplished individuals: 'The usual native explanation of the practice under discussion is that the name of the slain is adopted as a distinction. It draws attention to the fact that a man is embo-dari or mai-dari, i.e. a man-slayer, and marks him, therefore, as one of valour, koropahuso, ‘strong or expert with the spear’. It serves to commemorate his exploit.' <sup id="cite_ref-1038" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1038">[1,038]</a></sup> 'There is another kind of distinction, viz. the wearing of certain ornaments, &amp;c., which may be described as homicidal insignia. To these is given the general name otohu, or the specific name of esa. The latter will be found more satisfactory here. The subject of these insignia among the Orokaiva is not so straightforward as we might expect, owing to the fact-a happy one from all points of view save the present-that homicide has long gone out of fashion, or at least no longer bears an honorific implication, so that the customs connected with it cannot be studied directly. The best written on the subject is found in the admirable article by the late W. N. Beaver in the Annual Report, 1918-19, pp. 96-9.' <sup id="cite_ref-1039" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1039">[1,039]</a></sup> 'The source of confusion is in the fact that otohu ornaments are also given in connexion with initiation, where they certainly do not imply that the recipient has been a man-slayer. The concrete fact that they are given to girls as well as to boys or men is enough to prove this. Beaver [Page 178] made a distinction between homicidal otohu and ‘pig-otohu’, the former being conditioned by the killing of a man, the latter virtually bought with a pig. My own inquiries confirm this distinction, though I would attach more importance to the latter class than he does, and would prefer to state the matter thus, that the esa, or homicidal insignia, are a special class of otohu. The general subject of otohu will be discussed in the next chapter.' <sup id="cite_ref-1040" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1040">[1,040]</a></sup> 'In the meantime it appears that the man-slayer, having undergone the forms of purification or exorcism, might at some convenient date receive his otohu, or, as I shall call it, qua homicidal insigne, his esa. I say ‘might’ because some of the older informants have assured me that an esa was not given invariably. Moreover, it seems that certain ornaments, which are rightly enough otohu, have been too freely regarded as esa, i.e. as implying that their possessor must be a homicide. My own inquiries have led me to believe that the variety of homicidal insignia was very limited. Beaver has given two lists, one for the coastal and central tribes and one for the Wasida and the trans-Kumusi. The first is of eight, and the second of twelve alternative ornaments or objects. (It will be understood that the River People in the north observe similar customs and use similar esa.) I do not repeat these in full, but draw attention to several of the more striking. It seems likely that Nos. 1 and 2 (the hornbill beaks and the cuscus fur) were exclusive homicidal insignia or esa proper, i.e. they could be worn only by man-slayers. But save for these two, and possibly though doubtfully for the other three mentioned with them, I am led to believe that the long list of ornaments given by Beaver, as well as many others mentioned by native informants, were presented just as readily to the peaceful initiate as to the successful warrior.' <sup id="cite_ref-1041" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1041">[1,041]</a></sup> 'Beaver has given some interesting hints as to the symbolism of various esa. For example, the Bati-ananya symbolizes ‘the clawing hands and grinning teeth of the dead’. Again, ‘simba-a head-dress of dogs’ teeth, “sapi sapi” shells and beads, symbolical of the head smashed in by the stone club (?)’. The interrogation mark in the latter case makes it appear as if the writer did not entirely trust his informant, and while such symbolic interpretations are worth recording, we may well doubt whether they are the generally accepted interpretations, or, indeed, whether any general interpretation exists. It is not impossible that the above meanings are the extempore creations of imaginative informants reading their own meaning into the object on the spur of the moment; and I dare say that if we sought them we could discover a variety of symbolic interpretations for any one esa.' <sup id="cite_ref-1042" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1042">[1,042]</a></sup> 'The main purpose of the esa is apparently honorific. To the Orokaiva it is, or was, an ambition to kill a man, and the man-slayer was in a manner lionized. When a warrior who already had a victim to his credit held an enemy at his mercy, he might forbear out of generosity and call on another to administer the finishing blow, and so earn the right of wearing what to an Orokaiva was perhaps the proudest possible distinction.' <sup id="cite_ref-1043" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1043">[1,043]</a></sup> 'It is the invariable custom to call upon some old warrior of distinction to bestow these ornaments: such a man is called aguma or atemba. On this occasion at Divina Kovari there were three of them, and I shall describe their part in the ceremony at some length.' <sup id="cite_ref-1044" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1044">[1,044]</a></sup> 'The Otohu. It remains now to say something further of the otohu. I have already referred to the homicidal otohu, or esa, in Chapter XI, and described the rites observed in the bestowal of the ordinary otohu in the present chapter. It is now our task to consider the meaning-or the various meanings-of the word. The otohu may for the present be defined as one of a number of distinctive ornaments or objects which, at a price, are ceremonially bestowed, and which the recipient is thenceforward entitled to wear or use. It will be understood that any one who was, so to speak, masquerading with an otohu would be exposed to obloquy or ridicule. In earlier days it is doubtful whether any man would have had the hardihood or folly to attempt it. Where, therefore, one sees a man holding a highly ornamented lime gourd with a shell mouth-piece, or a string bag decorated with dogs' teeth, or wearing cuscus streamers tied at intervals with bunches of feathers, it may be concluded that he has paid the price for them (or probably that the price has been paid in his behalf) and that he is fully entitled to their use.'  <sup id="cite_ref-1045" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1045">[1,045]</a></sup> 'There is a considerable variety of these ceremonial objects, e.g. a specially ornamented bo or string bag (eti or hetava), decorated spears or stone clubs, bone forks for eating, lime-pots, belts embroidered with saima shells or made of black creeper cord, cuscus streamers, &amp;c. More commonly they take the form of ornaments (hambo) for the breast or forehead-hornbill beaks set in a half-circle, gana, huave, bono, and the like (vide p. 39). They are always fine examples of their kind, and in some cases are extremely [Page 202] ornate, with pendants and rosettes of dogs' teeth and scarlet seeds. They do not take the form of feather head-dresses, which constitute what I have throughout called the kokumbari. It will be understood, though, that the word kokumbari means literally ‘decorate’, and might correctly be applied to the otohu. A distinction is sometimes drawn between dikokumbari (bird or feather decoration) and hambo-kokumbari (ornament decoration), the latter, of course, meaning the otohu. However, I shall continue to restrict the word ‘kokumbari’ to the feather decorations which every initiate receives, and which are, as it were, cheaper than the otohu.' <sup id="cite_ref-1046" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1046">[1,046]</a></sup> 'I have been assured that, whereas the kokumbari is given properly by the nobo, the otohu is given by the mama (not the actual father, but one of the paternal uncles); but we find that the latter rule, like the former, will not come well out of the wash. It is customary, of course, for the candidate's parents to supply the pig which is the price of the otohu. (In some cases he does so himself.) The father will bespeak the services of some other-a craftsman-to make the actual ornament, and this man (the otohu-embo) is called upon as much for his skill and artistry as for any special relationship he bears to the boy. Among twenty-one cases it appeared that the otohu-embo was mama to the candidate in nine (in one of them he was the real father), nobo in six, bitepemi in three, nabori in one, ahije (grandfather) in one, and in the last he was of no recognized relationship but merely otavo, or friend, to the candidate's father.' <sup id="cite_ref-1047" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1047">[1,047]</a></sup> 'There is no actual social necessity for every man to receive an otohu, though it seems probable that at some time or other nearly every one does.

Again, as we have seen, the otohu may be given to the manslayer (though this is not absolutely invariable). But it appears further that an opportunity for bestowing an otohu might be made at any and every ceremony. Thus, for instance, [Page 203] at a dance in Petakiari, when a widow ceremonially discarded her mourning jacket of baja, or Job's Tears, she was presented with an otohu in the form of a specially decorated bo, and this with all the usual formalities.' <sup id="cite_ref-1049" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1049">[1,049]</a></sup> 'In view of these facts we may regard the otohu as embodying a social distinction. It implies that its owner has paid a pig, or that it has been paid in his behalf, and thus the ornament has been formally and regularly acquired. Further, to the native who loves ostentation the otohu is worth having for its own sake, apart from any social distinction it may connote: it is a fine thing, for instance, to wear a ‘magnet-shaped’ shell ornament (mendo) passed through one's nose-hole and dangling somewhat awkwardly in front of one's lips, or to sit and rattle one's spatula noisily in the shell mouth-piece of an otohu lime-pot. In short the otohu has both honorific and decorative value.' <sup id="cite_ref-1050" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1050">[1,050]</a></sup>  However, Orokaiva society was generally egalitarian.</dd>
<dd><b>♠ purity ♣ present ♥</b> Initiands of the Taro cult had to keep certain taboos: 'The disciple sometimes has to undergo a kind of probation. Having once acquired the Taro he must, for a considerable period (until, indeed, it is thoroughly established or ingrained into him), observe certain taboos. The chief of these is the taboo against washing. There are instances in which the enthusiastic acolyte forgoes the pleasures of a midday bathe for as long as eight months. When the Taro cult had crept insidiously into one of the mission schools, its presence was first [Page 33] detected-among a class of well-grown young females-by the missionary's nostrils. The reason for this taboo seems to lie in the supposed efficacy of running water, which will not only cleanse away impurity, but also carry off and dissipate the mana of the prophet. It is in keeping with this idea that the Taro novice be allowed, if necessary, to wash in still, swampy water. The taboos which are incumbent upon the professing Taro man will call for further description. The probationary taboo against washing should normally come to an end only with the permission of the superior who has been responsible for the novice's entry into the cult; but it must not be supposed that this rule is carried out in any strictness.' <sup id="cite_ref-1051" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1051">[1,051]</a></sup> 'It sometimes happens that an aspirant grows tired of the restrictions which are imposed upon him; and even a qualified Taro man may voluntarily break through them and ipso facto relinquish his status. Thus we find ‘resignations’, sometimes because of the constant tiresome jipari, sometimes because of the taboo upon bathing, sometimes because the temptation of forbidden foods cannot be resisted. One man said he had given over the Taro because he was hungry for eels, ohiti, which are banned to the faithful. Another, wounded in a village affray and temporarily incapacitated, had obtained a sort of absolution from the man who introduced him to the cult, and by bathing in a stream thus automatically ceased to be a Taro man.' <sup id="cite_ref-1052" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1052">[1,052]</a></sup> 'As certain medicines are prescribed for the Taro man either to increase his own power or else to be transmitted by him to the taro itself, so on the other hand there are many restrictions placed upon him for negative, but similar, reasons. He is in fact dieted with some strictness, and the reasons which govern these food taboos are worth considering. In a great majority of cases the man who observes the taboo is completely ignorant of any logical basis for it: he has learnt it by rote, so to speak, having received it as part of the cult from his instructor, and not only has he never heard a sensible argument in its favour, but, if taxed for such an argument, can think of none save ad verecundiam. But sometimes one meets a native with a spark of imagination. The explanations which he may give of the taboos are not necessarily the original ones, but notwithstanding they are typical native explanations, and at least as good as the original. A few examples will show what real grounds there are for the prohibitions. Pauri, the cuscus, is forbidden because of the yellowish colour of its fur, dappled with brown spots. Should the Taro man eat Pauri it is likely that the taro leaf will develop similar properties instead of keeping the rich green colour which is indicative of health. Auja, the red pandanus seed, and sasaru, a kind of frog, are tabooed for the same reason. It was explained that the frog, when cooked, is of a yellow-brown colour which is unwholesome not so much for the Taro man as for the taro. Ambe, or sago, was avoided in some quarters because the roots at the butt of the palm are often exposed in a way that is not desirable for the taro tuber. Imbaga the crocodile, wotomo a kind of flat fish, and ohiti the eel were ‘too heavy’. The idea of weight seems to be associated very commonly with sickness, and it is felt that the Taro man who ate creatures in which this quality is so obviously embodied, would be endangering his [Page 46] powers of healing. There are many more food taboos. Some of them may well enough be survivals from the Baigona cult (which placed a prohibition upon almost all creeping things), as they appear to have no very obvious bearing on Taro. Certain kinds of the taro itself were held to be injurious-only so, indeed, since the institution of the cult, for previously these forbidden varieties were eaten without any untoward result; Mr. Elder says they were given to his mission boys, ‘who being unbelievers thrived on them’.' <sup id="cite_ref-1053" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1053">[1,053]</a></sup> 'The taboo upon bathing has already been mentioned. It was evidently observed with a certain strictness and, in some cases at least, a breach of the taboo meant more than the mere loss of power. One Taro man of importance gave the following explanation for a lameness in the knee which had crippled him for eight months. Having used his spear too effectively in a village fight he was removed to jail, and there, under a regimen which took no heed of his priestly obligations, compelled to cut his hair and wash the smears of mud and white ochre off his body. The unfortunate prisoner's explanation still leaves one mystified: the dirt, mud, and paint being washed off the remainder of his body, concentrated in his knee and there brought on his lameness.' <sup id="cite_ref-1054" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1054">[1,054]</a></sup> The Taro spirit was also thought to harm non-specialist believers if taboos were violated: 'In the doctrines of the new cult it was maintained that a man might give offence to the actual taro spirit, and be punished by it with a sickness. Thus there were certain varieties of taro, perfectly wholesome, which were made taboo to the layman of the new cult. They were called koropa, or strong, and he ate them at the risk of illness. So again, according to Buninia and Yaviripa, taro might not be pulled without first consulting the Taro men. The taro spirits would be angry with one who was so disrespectful as to break this rule, and would enter into him and lay him up with a sickness.' <sup id="cite_ref-1055" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1055">[1,055]</a></sup> However, it is unclear whether these taboos constitute a form of impurity avoidance. The dead were associated with spiritual dangers: 'The native goes in real fear of his dead relatives and in perpetual anxiety lest he should offend them and incur their displeasure. This is probably the reason why a dead man's garden is taboo to his relatives: they fear he may infect the products of it out of sheer malice. If a man ate a banana which a binei had touched he would fall ill; so also if he ate one of the binei animals, i.e. one on which the dead was reincarnated; or, indeed, if he merely neglected the offerings and the observances which are due to the dead.' <sup id="cite_ref-1056" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1056">[1,056]</a></sup> Slayers had to observe taboos before undergoing ritual purification: 'Again the slayer must perform certain rites and observe certain tabus. He must not drink pure water out of the river, but only that which has been stirred up and made muddy by the feet of a non-slayer. He must not eat taro cooked in the pot, but only that which has been roasted in the open fire. He must abstain from sexual intercourse. These restrictions lasted for a few days and then the slayer ate the same purificatory stew (suna) which is given to initiates at the end of their seclusion (see p. 193). Among the Binandele I witnessed a mock demonstration of a peculiar rite which immediately preceded the eating of the suna. The slayer climbs into a small tree which contains a nest of those large and aggressive insects commonly called ‘green’ ants. The tree should properly be of the kind called Bobo, which [Page 175] is always swarming with them. While he crouches in a fork of the tree, branches are broken and laid over him so that he is almost completely covered and thoroughly bitten. Having endured this for some time, he climbs down and eats the suna, steaming himself over the dish and sponging his joints with handfuls of the stewed leaves. Another rite (also performed at the end of the initiate's seclusion) was to break a coco-nut above the slayer and souse his head with the milk.' <sup id="cite_ref-1057" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1057">[1,057]</a></sup> 'It seems likely that all these observances and tabus are in a sense not only purificatory but defensive. As a rule, informants have no explanation to offer, but I have been informed directly that they are meant to drive away the asisi, or spirit, of the slain man. In support of this view I may quote what W. N. Beaver has written: ‘I am not disposed to the sole view that the killer is “unclean”. It seems to me rather that rites are necessary to throw off the power of the ghost or ghosts of the slain….’' <sup id="cite_ref-1058" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1058">[1,058]</a></sup> Initiands also underwent ritual purification: 'The initiates gather round the dish of suna and bend over it so as to be fumigated by the rising steam. They hold their hands in the steam, and then withdrawing them massage their joints. They take handfuls of the hot leaves and apply them to their private parts, their hip-joints, their elbows, their arm-pits, &amp;c. They end by eating the stew. The other villagers stand by, themselves partaking and sponging their bodies with the leaves. The suna is sometimes set out in a wooden dish (teva) and a hot stone placed in it to increase the volume of steam, while the initiates stooping over the dish may be covered with pandanus mats to give them something like a Turkish bath.' <sup id="cite_ref-1059" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1059">[1,059]</a></sup> 'After partaking of the suna the initiate is at liberty to resume his full diet. (During the last two or three days he has eaten nothing but banana and sugar-cane.) But even so he must be cautious. Before passing him a piece of taro one of the elders will pass it under his legs-a queer precaution which appears again and again in Orokaiva ceremonies, either as a purification or as a prophylaxis. Having thus received the taro, the hungry initiate must nibble it only and put it aside for a while. Furthermore, he must not handle it, but convey it to his mouth on a piece of stick as a fork. If he should handle it and afterwards scratch his head the penalty would be the severe one of baldness.' <sup id="cite_ref-1060" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1060">[1,060]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ kinship ♣ present ♥</b> According to eHRAF, Orokaiva society was organized in patrilineal clans: 'Every Orokaiva is recruited by birth into the clan of his or her father. All members of a clan claim, but cannot necessarily trace, common descent from a usually eponymous ancestor. Each clan is subdivided into named subgroups or lineages that trace their origin to a named ancestor.' <sup id="cite_ref-1061" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1061">[1,061]</a></sup> 'Kinship terminology is of the Iroquois type.' <sup id="cite_ref-1062" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1062">[1,062]</a></sup> Williams confirms this: 'The Orokaiva are divided into a number of large tribes which may be named at this point. The classification rests mainly on a basis of language and follows, with a little amplification, the list made by Chinnery and Beaver. It must [Page 6] be understood, however, that the present is a very rough-and-ready statement of the case; for there is far more blending and complexity than appears in a bare list of nine tribes. A fuller treatment of the classification of tribes will be given in Chapter X; in the meantime the principal of them are: 1. Binandele and Jeva Buje. 2. Tain-Daware. 3. Aiga. 4. Yega. 5. Sauaha. 6. Sangara. 7. Dirou. 8. Wasida. 9. Hunjara. Their disposition may be seen on the map.' <sup id="cite_ref-1063" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1063">[1,063]</a></sup> 'The native roughly classifies these tribes according to their environment. The River People are called Umo-ke, lit. ‘water-language’; they comprise the Binandele of the Mambare and Gira rivers and the large branch of the same tribe called Jeva Buje, inhabiting the lower Kumusi. The coastal Tain-Daware and Yega are called Eva-Embo, ‘Salt-water Men’, and the inland tribes are collectively known as Autembo, ‘Bushmen’, or more often as Pereho (Berepo), a word which has the same general meaning, or more specifically stands for the ‘little bush-pigs’ that are captured wild in the forest. There are naturally some environmental differences between these large groups, but it appears that such differences are not essential. There seems to be no good ground other than group-conceit for the opinion of an Aiga that the Bush People were momoseja, attractive and ‘pretty’ (the same word would be applied to a brilliant croton leaf), while the River People were kamoseja, ugly and unattractive, with black skins like Kiwais, ringworm, and elephantiasis.' <sup id="cite_ref-1064" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1064">[1,064]</a></sup> 'The Control of Children. Children become members of the father's clan and naturally assume his clan emblem. They thus belong essentially to the father rather than to the mother. In cases of divorce, for example, it is normal for the child to remain in the custody of the father, unless it be an infant at the breast, when the matter may be waived, though compensation is due to the husband. The case of orphans is similar. Although there appears to be no formal adoption they are cared for in the normal case by the people of their father, being regarded indeed as their property.' <sup id="cite_ref-1065" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1065">[1,065]</a></sup> Generally, multiple lineages were represented at a locality: 'The social system is characterized by flexibility in arrangements for group membership and for transmission of rights to land. A village normally contains more than one clan branch and consequently is not necessarily a landholding unit. Residents may have closer kinship ties to residents of other villages than with some of their coresidents. Nevertheless, common residence implies some community of interest and a degree of group solidarity that is reinforced by government policy, which recognizes villages rather than descent groups as functional entities. Marriages between members of different clan branches within the village also reinforce this solidarity, which is expressed in ways such as daily food gifts, cooperation in certain tasks, and joint ceremonial activities. On the average, a lineage comprises three households. Usually, several clans are represented in a village, with members of a single clan (clan branches) being scattered among a number of neighboring villages. Lineages are more localized in cha racter, frequently being confined to a single village and tending to occupy one section of it.' <sup id="cite_ref-1066" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1066">[1,066]</a></sup> Kin relations organized mutual aid and cooperation: 'Kinship groups are of major importance in the functioning of village society in New Guinea. Every individual is a member not only of a parish but also of groups of closer kin, a clan, and maybe a lineage. Lacking any system of payment in cash for services rendered, the villager obtains the assistance of his relatives for heavy work such as the felling of big trees to make a swidden, dragging a canoe log to the beach, or making a long seine fishing net. Obligations thus incurred are met either by reciprocating when asked or by making a gift. The kinship group provides social stability and in practice the pattern of land use is frequently decided by the senior members of the group. The planting of food crops by any member, even on land to which he does not control cultivation rights, causes no concern because rights to temporary usage may be easily granted, but the planting of tree crops, which may remain in the ground from thirty to eighty years, is a different matter. Planting tree crops is tantamount to alienating the land for at least a generation and very often some members, at least, of the kinship group object to such long-term use. Even if they do agree to an individual member planting tree crops, there is almost always the assumption that he must share any profit he makes with other members of the group. Individuals who have planted cash crops under these conditions generally become discouraged when they see the fruits of their labours being reaped by kinsmen who contribute little or nothing towards production.' <sup id="cite_ref-1067" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1067">[1,067]</a></sup> 'Each clan controls some areas of mature rain forest, some of secondary forest, and some of grassland. Only the secondary forest is regarded as valuable garden land. The mature rain forest is potential garden land of the future, and grassland is unimportant, except for hunting. Clan land-holdings are fragmented within the confines of Yega territory. This pattern can be explained partly by the social system of land use and partly by the history of Yega expansion inland from the coast. The members of different lineages belonging to the same clan normally combine to clear areas of rain forest by communal labour. When the work is completed the land is divided among the lineages which helped clear it. This is the origin of the pattern of large continuous strips of land belonging to one clan, but sub-divided amongst the sub-clans and lineages of that clan as shown in Fig. 3. The commonly elongated shape of clan holdings is the result of continuous clearing in one direction by a group of kinsmen talking and joking as they worked and thus keeping close together. The small enclaves of land shown within the general Kurou clan area but belonging to other clans (Fig. 3) may be explained by affinal relationships. At various times the Kurou men cutting down the forest gave permission to some men of other clans, who had married Kurou women, to work with them. These affinal kinsmen thus acquired cultivation rights to small pieces of land, which have been inherited by their descendents. The first areas cleared were close to the coast; as population increased and more land was required, the inland forests were cut down in the manner described above.' <sup id="cite_ref-1068" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1068">[1,068]</a></sup> Clans held land: 'Before we can fully understand the system of using the land, it is necessary to describe the system under which it is owned. Among the Orokaiva there is a multiplicity of small clans, which from time to time increases by subdivision (a process which is in part neutralized by the dying out of older clans). Now the land is owned in reality by the clan. The fact that very commonly the clan is a local unity, being often coincident with the single village, makes this system a simple one in the normal instance. Sometimes, however, the clan is somewhat [Page 125] scattered, occupying several villages or parts of several villages. In this case the clan will in all probability retain a nominal ownership of all its lands; but in practice it is customary for the various sections to assume by general consent or else by the allocation of a headman, the occupation and usage of particular parts of the land. In due time the section is likely to adopt a distinctive name, and to develop into an independent clan: the right of usage tacitly becomes ownership, and we find the normal condition restored, viz. the clan locally unified and in possession of its own tracts of land. A system exactly similar governs the ownership of the small waterways (useful for fishing) and of the sago swamps.' <sup id="cite_ref-1069" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1069">[1,069]</a></sup> Individuals retained ties with maternal kin: 'The maternal uncle (nobo) has no real authority over the child, and his ceremonial obligations towards it are somewhat vague. However, there exists a cordial relationship between the two, and the nobo is treated with respect as a relative of importance. It is worth remarking that an Orokaiva child, while belonging to the people of its father, is very ready to identify itself also with those of its mother. When living with the latter and helping the maternal uncle in his work the child feels itself to belong for the time being to the maternal clan. At such a time it will use the maternal plant emblem, and indeed at all times it will name that emblem as subsidiary to the one it inherits from its father. In short, where the child, who belongs indisputably to its father's clan, is still on such friendly and intimate footing with its mother's, we might say that the system, although patrilineal in theory, was almost bilateral in effect.' <sup id="cite_ref-1070" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1070">[1,070]</a></sup> Fission was common and the system was therefore somewhat flexible. This was also how new clans originated: 'Although the clan is a fairly well-defined group, it is difficult to find a satisfactory native name for it in the abstract. Among the Aiga the nearest approach seems to be the expression embo-javo, lit. ‘man-name’; but this might stand in another context for the man's personal name. Among the Binandele there is a more definite term oro-be, ‘the true oro’ (the usual meaning of oro is men's house). In the Sangara dialect a word araha stands for either a village clearing or a clan. In the absence of a suitable native name I shall continue to use the word ‘clan’.' <sup id="cite_ref-1071" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1071">[1,071]</a></sup> 'The Formation of New Clans. The Orokaiva clan is patriarchal in constitution; it develops directly from the family in which the father is undisputed master. The clans vary greatly in size, but for the most part they are small; one of a dozen families might represent the average.' <sup id="cite_ref-1072" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1072">[1,072]</a></sup> 'Consequently they are very numerous, and, as each and every one shows a tendency to split, they are not decreasing in number. Indeed, at the present time, when pacification has made it less essential to cling together for protection, it is possible there are more clans than ever before.' <sup id="cite_ref-1073" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1073">[1,073]</a></sup> 'As the multiplying family merges into the clan it is not always easy to set a limit or a definition. But when the descendants of one man come to be known regularly by a distinctive name, it may be said that they constitute a new clan.'  <sup id="cite_ref-1074" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1074">[1,074]</a></sup> 'In some instances the clan is quite or nearly coincident with the village, i.e. the village is populated solely by one clan, and the clan is limited to that one village. Such a case is probably an elementary one, and the clan of comparatively recent origin. I will suggest a reason for this state of affairs and for the origin of the clans in general. There is an evident tendency for small family units to split off from the main body and form independent settlements. The reason is sometimes a quarrel and the fear of retaliatory magic, but more often, I believe, it is simply the lax method of horticulture which necessitates the clearing of many areas in succession and sometimes a temporary settlement on a distant site. This distant site is planted with coco-nut and betel, and, when subsequently the garden is again made on or about the same spot, it becomes the temporary home of a small settlement. But now one or two men may establish themselves here permanently with their families. So long as they retain their original clan name the settlement can only be regarded as an offshoot; but when they wax in numbers and begin to be known by a separate name, they become ipso facto a separate clan.' <sup id="cite_ref-1075" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1075">[1,075]</a></sup> 'This process goes on continually. It means that originally the clan occupies a single village (a fact which is hinted at by the dual meaning of araha). In the hamlet of Borugata, for example, there are three houses and a combined yam-house and shelter. The head of the village is one Pipire, a man of middle age, who has three wives and thirteen children (an unusually large quiverful for an Orokaiva). The wife and son of his deceased brother are the only other occupants of the village. This small village of Borugata is an offshoot from another, Tandeti, inhabited by the clan Anjaha. As yet Pipire and his children retain the clan name of Anjaha; but it will be seen that we have the makings of a new clan, and it is only necessary for this small and essentially [Page 103] patriarchal group to receive a distinctive name for it to become a separate clan.' <sup id="cite_ref-1076" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1076">[1,076]</a></sup> 'While in origin the clan and the village are co-extensive, this state of affairs is by no means always maintained. War, dispersal, and migration have scattered some clans and drawn others together; so that now on the one hand we may find representatives of one clan in a number of villages, and on the other a single village comprising several clans. In the latter place it is found that the several clans occupy more or less distinct locations.' <sup id="cite_ref-1077" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1077">[1,077]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ bravery ♣ present ♥</b> Fierceness was valued: 'Since the interest of this chapter will be principally with intra-group morality we may dismiss the other side of the question rather briefly. We have seen that the Orokaiva tribe lived in a state of ever-recurring warfare with some or other of its neighbours. There were peace-makings or truces, but the truce was always a fragile one, and no village lived in permanent security. The Orokaiva achieved and probably deserved a warlike reputation, and in such conditions it is not surprising that they should set some store upon the virtue of bravery-though it does not seem to take the foremost place that we might expect. A brave warrior was called koropa-embo, a ‘spearman’, or ivu-embu, a ‘manly man’, ivu being the word for husband or a fully matured man. Another term is sarika, which is perhaps best translated ‘formidable’, and connotes not only fierceness but size and strength. (By way of example one of the late magistrates of the Division was called sarika on account of stature, and another on account of his severity.) A coward is called atoha-embo or jouro-huso, and of course there are to be found some cowards among a generally brave race. Some of my informants in one village named a few men as atoha (and it is interesting to note in passing that, like true native gentlemen, they named them in whispers for fear the men in question should overhear and have their feelings hurt).' <sup id="cite_ref-1078" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1078">[1,078]</a></sup> 'But more striking than any bravery is the sheer blood-thirstiness which seems actually to be raised to the status of a virtue. It is not for fearlessness that the insignia called esa or otohu (p. 177) are bestowed, but for the mere taking of human life. Many an old warrior, counting over his victims, will show as great a pride in the slaughter of women and children as in a man-to-man victory; and indeed the majority of Orokaiva victims have met their end in surprise and massacre rather than in fair fight. While I have found no evidence to show that the Orokaiva was expected sometime [Page 312] during his career to take a human life, as if this were a social imperative, it is not too much to say that every individual aspired to be a man-slayer, and that his success brought him a great deal of honour.' <sup id="cite_ref-1079" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1079">[1,079]</a></sup> 'The Orokaiva say that the dambo relation, although similar in many respects, is colder, more formal than the simbo relation. If a man dies in war, his simbo will die with him. The same intensity of feeling was not expressed about agnates. The feeling is the same where female simbo are concerned, except that “women cannot always do what men do.” Simbo relations were especially important during the period of courting, war-like raids, and bravery in collecting war trophies.' <sup id="cite_ref-1080" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1080">[1,080]</a></sup> This was reflected in initiations: 'Williams, in fact, cannot support the argument that initiation required homicide, although a man-slayer has considerable distinction desired by all young men (1930:170, 176, 179). The homicidal insignia ‘otohu’ are given at initiations but do not imply the obligation to murder. During seclusion, tribal morals are stressed and much effort is expended on learning to play the flute. The ceremony when the youths come out, however, puts considerable emphasis on the exploits of old warriors. The circumstances of each homicide are described and the youths are exhorted to bravery and blood thirstiness (Williams 1930:189-90).' <sup id="cite_ref-1081" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1081">[1,081]</a></sup> 'Reay confirmed this as late as 1952 when she described the anachronistic training of Orokaivan boys for warfare, which, aside from the initiation, is still apparent today. (The area was declared pacified in 1904.) Men deliberately frighten small boys by making strange noises and lunging at them threateningly, and attempt to instil terror with masks, bullroarers and flutes at the initiation of pubescent youths. All this, plus the public admiration for warleaders, is geared to instil bravery, fearlessness and a respect for authority in the boys (Reay 1953:111-14). Aside from Waiko's description of the Binandere, there is little evidence of actual fighting instruction given to youths such as those given to the Mae Enga youths of the PNG highlands or to the Yanomamo boys of Venezuela and Columbia. Meggitt (1977:62) describes how an Enga man makes a scaled-down spear and bow and arrow for his son who pracises assiduously and learns the rules of skilled fighting. Yanomamo socialisation encourages ferocity. Children are teased until they hit; [Page 492] anger is rewarded; faked temper tantrums are encouraged; play warfare is practised; and contests such as chest pounding emulated (Chagnon 1968a:130-32). Whether or not the practical skills of fighting are instilled during the Orokaivan seclusion period, it can be seen that the ideological support of the murder of enemies is a major feature of the associated ceremonies. The combined evidence of settlement pattern, defence construction, sentry duties and education of young men, testifies that a significant amount of time used to be devoted to the political relations of warfare.' <sup id="cite_ref-1082" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1082">[1,082]</a></sup> Bravery was also celebrated when individuals received certain insignia, but this could be ambiguous: 'The aguma exhorts the ehamei to bravery, and the reason for telling of his own prowess is to give them something to emulate. Such a demonstration, I understand, always marks the ceremony of investiture with the otohu. It is typical of a savage people to whom valour or mere blood-thirstiness is one of the first virtues. The Orokaiva is not only brave enough but exceedingly vainglorious: he loves to make a great show of martial prowess. It is interesting to note that this, like other ceremonies, has a sort of ambivalence, wavering between belief and make-believe, or between seriousness and banter. While the distinguished warrior is shouting his exploits, a chorus of young men stand by beating their drums and making fun of the old man in their songs. I have recorded one of the songs appropriate to the occasion: Poponi opi be kajari keko. which means that the old aguma is a boaster and a liar, that he never thrust his spear through the body of a man, but merely poked him with a shoot (opi) of the Poponi tree.' <sup id="cite_ref-1083" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1083">[1,083]</a></sup></dd>
<dd><b>♠ respect for property ♣ present ♥</b> Orokaiva society was organized in patrilineal clans: 'Every Orokaiva is recruited by birth into the clan of his or her father. All members of a clan claim, but cannot necessarily trace, common descent from a usually eponymous ancestor. Each clan is subdivided into named subgroups or lineages that trace their origin to a named ancestor.' <sup id="cite_ref-1084" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1084">[1,084]</a></sup> 'Kinship terminology is of the Iroquois type.' <sup id="cite_ref-1085" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1085">[1,085]</a></sup> Clans and lineages held and transmitted lands, but individuals owned and distributed garden plots within lineage territory: 'Inheritance is usually patrilineal.' <sup id="cite_ref-1086" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1086">[1,086]</a></sup> 'Various land rights may be given to the clan branch, the lineage, or an individual, the relative significance of each varying with the locality and population density. More than one descent group may have rights in a single piece of land. In many instances, the clan branch functions as a reference group, with all land being associated with it. However, it may also function as a primary right-holding group for those hunting areas distinct from current garden land, typically the grasslands. Primary rights to garden land are normally vested in the lineage. Nevertheless, all such land is ultimately identifiable with individuals who may distribute land (and property) prior to their death not only to their immediate family but also to more distant kin. Traditional tree crops are not planted in stands or groups like cash-crop trees but are widely scattered and are as likely to be planted on patrimonial land as on the land of affines or matrilateral kin. Inheritance of rights to trees usually does not bring rights to the land on which they stand.' <sup id="cite_ref-1087" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1087">[1,087]</a></sup> Williams provides a general description of the property system: 'Before we can fully understand the system of using the land, it is necessary to describe the system under which it is owned. Among the Orokaiva there is a multiplicity of small clans, which from time to time increases by subdivision (a process which is in part neutralized by the dying out of older clans). Now the land is owned in reality by the clan. The fact that very commonly the clan is a local unity, being often coincident with the single village, makes this system a simple one in the normal instance. Sometimes, however, the clan is somewhat [Page 125] scattered, occupying several villages or parts of several villages. In this case the clan will in all probability retain a nominal ownership of all its lands; but in practice it is customary for the various sections to assume by general consent or else by the allocation of a headman, the occupation and usage of particular parts of the land. In due time the section is likely to adopt a distinctive name, and to develop into an independent clan: the right of usage tacitly becomes ownership, and we find the normal condition restored, viz. the clan locally unified and in possession of its own tracts of land. A system exactly similar governs the ownership of the small waterways (useful for fishing) and of the sago swamps.' <sup id="cite_ref-1088" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1088">[1,088]</a></sup> 'The Orokaiva clan is virtually a patriarchal group; there is no real chieftainship, but a recognized ascendancy of the old man, provided his vigour of mind and body is equal to his position. As it begins to fail his place is gradually occupied by a younger man. Only in the larger clans, where there are well-defined family groups, does the question of hereditary succession appear, and then it is a somewhat faint appearance.' <sup id="cite_ref-1089" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1089">[1,089]</a></sup> 'It is sometimes said that the chief owns the land, though this is hardly more than a form of speech. He does something, however, towards administering it. For instance, he can say which area is to be laid under cultivation at any time, and he can subdivide and allot the territory of the clan among its branches. He feels himself and is felt to be the guardian of the land. Thus we hear an old man telling how his father had given him death-bed injunctions-‘Friday he talk, Saturday he die,’ as the interpreter put it in order to make clear the testamentary nature of the charge-to allow all his own people to make their gardens on the clan's territory, but to suffer no strangers.' <sup id="cite_ref-1090" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1090">[1,090]</a></sup> 'Among the members of the clan there is a very considerable amount of personal freedom, and, except in so far as there may be an allocation of land and fishing rights between branches or families, they may in theory make their gardens where they please. There is occasional [Page 126] wrangling as to garden boundaries, but these petty disagreements within the clan, so to speak, are as a rule easily settled. The land disputes which bring endless trouble and labour to the magistrate are disputes between clans. While the land is owned communally the garden is owned individually. Between two adjacent gardens the boundary is made of felled trees, laid end to end, sometimes in two rows so as to form a path between. So long as this ground is under cultivation, not only the produce of the garden but the garden itself is individual property, and a displacement of the boundary would mean a quarrel.' <sup id="cite_ref-1091" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1091">[1,091]</a></sup> Williams describes the allocation of garden plots: 'I may now describe the system by which the land is used: it may be called a Rotation of Areas. Each clan will possess a number of tracts of land, which bear locality names. These may or may not be contiguous. Often, owing to migratory habits or to the reclamation of some distant and hitherto unoccupied block of land, they may be somewhat scattered.' <sup id="cite_ref-1092" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1092">[1,092]</a></sup> 'When the gardener finds himself clearing once more on the familiar ground which was used perhaps many years before, he does not necessarily plant on the precise spot which was his previously. There is, as a rule, so much ground to spare that he is welcome to begin where he pleases, and without the risk of offending a fellow clansman. It does sometimes happen, however, that a man acquires a sort of prescriptive right to the immediate [Page 129] locality where he has worked, and accordingly we sometimes find an easy-going division of an area between families or branches of the clan. No doubt this becomes a stricter division where the available land is circumscribed; for individual ownership of land probably has its origin in scarcity of land.' <sup id="cite_ref-1093" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1093">[1,093]</a></sup> The interests of clans and families could be at odds with each other: 'It is only necessary to stress the point that the immediate family is recognized as a social unit; and the mere fact that a man sometimes quarrels with the members of his clan and migrates with his family or settles somewhere apart, proves that the family interest may compete with that of the clan. Both units are co-operative, the family especially in respect of the food quest, the clan in respect of ceremonies and feasts, and more importantly of fighting. The clan owns the garden land, but the family cultivates its own patch and reaps its own harvest. On the whole, since the clan displays a constant tendency to split into smaller groups of which the family is the nucleus, it is difficult to draw a line between the two. Yet for the same reason we may be right in saying that the family, as the indivisible unit, exerts the stronger hold.' <sup id="cite_ref-1094" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1094">[1,094]</a></sup> Owners of garden plots built magical markers and barriers in order to protect them from intruders: 'With respect to property it is worth noting under this head the various tangible protection marks. Whatever their sanctions they have no real value as physical barriers to trespass or appropriation.' <sup id="cite_ref-1095" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1095">[1,095]</a></sup> '(1) The commonest is papara or ese, the frond of coco-nut palm tied about the butt, which means that no one is to [Page 324] climb for nuts. (2) The heri is a strip of bark or a liana tied to uprights and encircling a house or some forbidden ground. (3) A harihari is some object, usually leaf or twig, placed in the cleft of a split stick and set up, e.g., at the mouth of a creek as a sign of a fishing right. (4) Inja is simply a few handfuls of grass laid across a track to bar the passage. We might include (5) the naterari and pamba (p. 226), which serve to mark a village tabu on the coco-nuts, and (6) logically enough the ordinary garden boundary, tani, which consists merely of a series of tree-trunks or branches laid on the ground between adjacent plots. These are all regarded quite strictly: no man would step over an inja or take a short cut across an area enclosed by a heri. Less regular marks which may serve as reminders for some casual rule are observed with equal stringency. For instance, I have seen an eight of diamonds wedged in a split stick and set up in a village to forbid the playing of cards; it had been erected by a man of influence who has somehow acquired conscientious scruples regarding the forbidden game. The sanctions for the strict observance of these marks will be discussed presently; the signs themselves are described here merely to show the existence of tangible safeguards, principally, but not always, of the law of property.' <sup id="cite_ref-1096" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1096">[1,096]</a></sup> Given the practice of erecting magical barriers in order to police trespassing supernaturally, some 'respect for property' may have been present. Williams' comments on other kinds of prohibitions confirm this: 'There is a word igege (Binandele yege) which may be translated ‘moral law’, or perhaps, since the examples are all negative, ‘moral prohibition’. The examples were such as the following: not to steal a man's vegetables, canoes, spears, &amp;c.; not to usurp his fishing rights; not to take his dog to hunt, but to drive it back if it followed the hunter of its own accord; not to commit adultery; not to beat one's wife overmuch; not to commit assault on another man. These igege were for adults; they did not apply to children, who had to be treated with so much indulgence; still less to dogs, whose nature it was to steal on sight. While not implying standardization, the mere existence of the word hints at a definite conception of right and wrong.' <sup id="cite_ref-1097" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1097">[1,097]</a></sup></dd></dl>
<p><b>♠ Moralistic punishment by human religious agents ♣ absent ♥</b> absent/present/unknown. 'Shamans' acted as healers and sorcerers and were in contact with spirits: 'The traditional beliefs of the Orokaiva, though in many respects vague and locally variable, focused primarily on the "spirits of the dead" and their influence on the living. The Orokaiva had no high god. Formerly, they were animists, believing in the existence of souls (ASISI) in humans, plants, and animals. The taro spirit was of particular importance and was the inspiration and foundation of the Taro Cult. The Orokaiva have been swept recently by a series of new cults, indicative of their religious adaptability in the face of fresh experience. Mission influence is strong in the Northern District. Religious training is provided almost exclusively by the Anglican church, although mission influence has not totally eradicated traditional beliefs, producing an air of mysticism about the resultant religious system.' <sup id="cite_ref-1098" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1098">[1,098]</a></sup> 'Orokaiva shamans, or "taro men" serve as healers, weather magicians, and sorcerers.' <sup id="cite_ref-1099" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1099">[1,099]</a></sup> 'Dances are held often, sometimes accompanied by music, singing, and drums. From time to time, bigmen sponsor large redistributive feasts, featuring pig sacrifices and food distribution. Activities associated with the taro cult (the "Kava Keva" cult) are the major ritual activity. The Taro Cult began about 1915 and soon evolved into ritual practices meant to placate the spirits of the dea (SOVAI) who control the taro crop. Thus, it is both a fertility cult and a cult of the dead. Taro men lead the ritual which includes choral singing, drumming, feasting, and violent shaking movements.' <sup id="cite_ref-1100" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1100">[1,100]</a></sup> Williams describes the origins of the Taro cult: 'From the account of the origin of the cult it will be seen that the prophet believed himself possessed by the spirit of the actual taro plant. When once the cult was set moving many others besides Buninia began to receive visitations, and informants who lived in his neighbourhood, i.e. near the Mambare mouth, expressly stated that the visitations were from spirits (atiti) of the taro (ba). This they realized most commonly by means of their dreams. There were spirits of all the multifarious kinds of the taro plant, Kaiva, Porove, Kivere, Ovivi, &amp;c., and not only of the taro but of other garden plants as well. It is too much to expect cut-and-dried dogma from natives, and there is confusion and haziness as to the nature and numbers of these plant spirits. There are probably at least a score of varieties of the taro cultivated by the Orokaiva, all of them readily distinguished by differences of leaf, stalk, or bulb. The taro spirits bear the names of these several varieties, but, according to the truly orthodox view propounded in the head-quarters of the cult, there are countless spirits for every variety. They join in disembodied forgatherings at the Ba nyasi, or Taro villages, Siri, Waiegi, Kome, and Duero-to name some of them-which are wooded hills along the picturesque coast between Deboi and Ambasi. They throng invisibly at the feasts in the real villages. As I was once talking with the Taro man Yaviripa (a rare opportunist in debate) he informed me that a taro spirit was close by us at the moment. He had met the spirit in a dream last night, and had been apprised of its intention to join the discussion; now a twitching in his shoulder told him that the appointment had been kept.' <sup id="cite_ref-1101" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1101">[1,101]</a></sup> We are unsure whether taro men enforced any moral norms in their communities. Sorcery was thought to cause sickness and misfortune, but this seems to constitute retaliation rather than moralistic punishment: 'Land may also act as a mediating element in a negative exchange between a sorcerer and a person who has aroused the anger of that sorcerer, as happens when the former blights the crops of the latter by placing a curse on the land. In many situations of this sort, events which we would class as metaphysical, physiological or climatological are explained as arising out of social exchange. Such beliefs tend to increase the importance attached to the maintenance of satisfactory social exchange relations because the averting of misfortune in the metaphysical, physiological and climatological realms is made conditional upon successful social relations.' <sup id="cite_ref-1102" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1102">[1,102]</a></sup> 'In respect of medical treatment the Taro cult has brought with it a few innovations, though these have by no means displaced the older methods. The Taro man makes free use of old and new. There are, however, in native belief several distinct sources of infirmity, according to which all ailments may be roughly classified. There is, first, the mild epidemic (yevi or hauni) which is regarded as a phenomenon of nature, brought by the cold wind, and which usually evinces itself in a headache and a fever. There is, secondly, a large class of ailments due to the evil influence of spirits of the dead; these are commonly attended by internal pains. Thirdly, there are those illnesses caused by sorcery (kai, inja, saruka), which have a variety of more or less severe symptoms. Now the illnesses of this last category are in a sense incurable: there is only one recognized way of curing the victim of sorcery, and that is for the sorcerer himself to withdraw or annul his evil influence. A Taro man will not treat a case of sorcery-sickness: he acknowledges that he can do nothing for it, and he has a means of diagnosis which is as simple as it is infallible. He tries his treatments: if they are not successful, and the patient is obviously dying or already dead, he says, ‘I am sorry, I can do nothing: this is a case of sorcery-sickness.’' <sup id="cite_ref-1103" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1103">[1,103]</a></sup> 'We may briefly discuss the charge of sorcery, which is cognate to doctoring and weather-magic. While the Taro man seems unable to disperse the drought, he is no [Page 64] doubt often accused of bringing it on. It is not to be supposed that weather-control belongs exclusively to the exponents of the new cult. It is merely an old-time institution which they have adapted to their own purpose; but this purpose is not always wholly in the public interest. It might probably be said that to the benevolence of magic there is always a reverse or malevolent side—sorcery. The native doctor is believed in because of some secret powers, or some secret methods: directly he uses these for an anti-social end he becomes a sorcerer. It is unnecessary to say that the sorcerer is believed to use his evil powers far more often than he actually attempts to use them: he is a sorcerer more by public opinion than by his own intent. But in this credulity he has the weapon for terrorism and extortion if he care to make use of it. A native doctor is a potential sorcerer: he can strike as well as cure.' <sup id="cite_ref-1104" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1104">[1,104]</a></sup> Taro men employed sorcery to retaliate against individuals who slighted them, but this does not seem to constitute third-party punishment: 'In the regular sorcery of the Orokaiva the agent affects his victim directly. The theory of Taro sorcery, however, is that the spirit (of the taro or the dead) enters into and injures the man who has offended it. The commonest way of offending the spirit is to offend the Taro man, to abuse him or quarrel with him, or to neglect to fete him in the proper manner. The spirit which visits or possesses the injured Taro man will enter into the offender and make him ill. Taro men alone can cure the illness by extracting or driving out the spirit. Thus we see the hold which the exponents of the cult have upon the Philistines. They have the powers of kaiembo or sorcerers (though they abjure the name); but they [Page 66] shoulder off the responsibilities on to the spirits. The theory (quite commonly understood) is that the spirit will resent any disrespect or inattention; and that to fail in respect or attention to the Taro man is to offend the spirit itself in the same way; hence the punishment of sickness. If, as one informant said, any one abused a Taro man, the spirit would overhear and enter the body of the abuser. Such, I am told, is the explanation of the queer practice of universal hand-shaking. One must keep on good terms with a Taro man.' <sup id="cite_ref-1105" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1105">[1,105]</a></sup> Williams makes no mention of moralistic punishment: 'While practically every one has been a willing convert to the Taro cult in so far as it meant participation in the song and feast, and while perhaps the majority have given way at some time or other to the pleasant abandonment of the jipari, there is a wide class of Taro experts or special exponents of the cult. It is impossible to set a definite limit to this class. There are some who are recognized as leaders and who are very strongly ‘possessed’, and others who are little more than laymen. However, it is possible to include them all under the name of ba-embo, which means literally ‘Taro man’. Such men, who, like the Baigona men, might be called priests of the cult, officiate and lead in the ceremonial feasting; they perform certain duties in the taro gardens; they make a special practice of jipari and similar contortions; and they subject themselves to certain taboos. The theory of their conduct is that of possession by a spirit, either of the taro itself or of the dead.' <sup id="cite_ref-1106" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1106">[1,106]</a></sup> 'We have yet to see the Taro man in several subsidiary roles—those of doctor, weather-magician, and sorcerer. There is a tendency in primitive society for many distinct functions to be concentrated in one person of preeminence. [Page 57] When a man is credited with supernormal powers in any department of life, he becomes an object at once of admiration and suspicion; and he would be more of a fool than he is if he did not make full and varied use of this imputed supernormality. Consequently, if a man by virtue of spiritual possession can prosper the taro, he can cure the sick and control the weather by the same means; and, it is to be feared, he can turn his gift of mana to account in other and less amiable directions.' <sup id="cite_ref-1107" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1107">[1,107]</a></sup> On the other hand, some colonial-period cults propagated moralistic messages as part of their ideology, which may be the result of contact with Christian missionaries: 'Dasiga dreamed and went up into the sky where he saw God, and received from Him certain instructions. [Page 75] As he recounted them to me they were commandments against ‘swearing’, theft, adultery, and anger, and two positive injunctions—to be like the missionaries and like the white men. He also laid down a form of service which has been well described by Mr. L. A. Flint, formerly the magistrate in charge of the Ioma District. The only record of this ceremony is the rotting wooden pillar in Manau around which the worshippers, led by Dasiga and Bia, were wont to assemble.' <sup id="cite_ref-1108" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1108">[1,108]</a></sup> 'After this interview with Bairi, Mr. Holland entered Manau and witnessed a service led by Dasiga, who was seated on a box in the midst of the worshippers. The preacher rose to greet him but broke out again into unintelligible incantations, shaking his head, and affecting to read out of the palm of his hand. He would finish his incantation by intoning Jesu Kerisu kaena-embo, ‘Jesus Christ the man for us’; otherwise his words were entirely meaningless. Mr. Holland asked what he saw in the palm of his hand, and was told that Christ's messages appeared there. Asked more precisely what the messages were, Dasiga replied, ‘This must not be written in a book’. ‘But’, said the missionary, ‘God is open and hides nothing.’ Admitting this, Dasiga (who must have been something of a dialectician) replied by a question: ‘Where do your people go when they die?’ ‘They sleep, then rise again and appear before God.’' <sup id="cite_ref-1109" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1109">[1,109]</a></sup> Williams claims that some Taro men attained leadership positions, although it is unclear whether this implied any moralistic punishment of adherents: 'The emergence of strong personalities who attain to an eminent position in the cult may give promise of a more advanced kind of chieftainship than the very primitive [Page 96] patriarchate which has been the Orokaiva fashion. While, however, we may welcome these signs of an incipient chieftainship in the power and influence of the Taro men, we cannot deny that they are to some extent—how far I have been unable to decide—founded upon the obnoxious practice of sorcery. Incidentally the theory of possession and the double role of priest and magician which the Taro man is called upon to play may give some colour to the theory that the functions of magician, priest, and chieftain were originally combined.' <sup id="cite_ref-1110" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1110">[1,110]</a></sup> We are unsure whether Kava-Keva practitioners enforced any moral norms. Christian missionaries were also active, but most Orokaiva did not accept the Christian notion of divine omnipotence, and converts to Christianity practiced syncretism: 'The Orokaiva attitude to Christianity is a complex subject which I intend to treat more fully elsewhere and falls somewhat outside the concern of our present project. It is very clear that some basic notion of Christian montheism have not been accepted by the Orokaiva, such as for instance the notion of God's omnipotence. Orokaiva Christians believe in the existence of God and in His infinite power, but He is viewed as an addition to other powers, Who is hostile to some of these other powers, but not necessarily to others. I was told that a person ought to give up black magic after baptism, but informants dismissed my suggestion that Christianity was also opposed to curing magic. No curing magician ever ceased practising when he was baptised.' <sup id="cite_ref-1111" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1111">[1,111]</a></sup> This might imply that the role of Christian missionaries as credible moral enforcers may have been limited

<dl><dd> <b>♠ physical punishment ♣ present ♥</b>  Social control was informal, but feuding and physical punishment were also practiced: 'There are customary restrictions upon feuding within the tribe, which exist in sharp contrast to the standard acceptance and formalization of hostility between tribes. Formerly, official legal penalties, generally violent, were meted out to criminals. Fear of the ancestors and desire to avoid unfavorable public opinion remain the major mechanisms of social control.' <sup id="cite_ref-1112" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1112">[1,112]</a></sup> In the native system, there was no central political force with the authority to punish: 'In Orokaiva society, sanctions operate diffusely and need no specific person's direction to put them into effect. The embo kiti, whom F. E. Williams called a “clan headman,” but who is really more of a village headman whose position is hereditary within a certain lineage of the clan, has a limited authority which is backed by no sanctions. He has no power to reward or punish, except by making obvious his approval or disapproval of various lines of action. In fact, there is no rewarding and punishing authority at all.' <sup id="cite_ref-1113" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1113">[1,113]</a></sup> Traditionally, retalitation was practiced instead and this could take both violent and non-violent forms: 'Retaliation seems to have been the commonest sanction in former times, in the form of direct violence or the more subtle method of socrery. Retaliation by sorcery may still be practised; I have no information on this point. Certainly deaths are still attributed to sorcery. When (during 1950) several people from the same village [Page 116] died within a couple of months, these deaths were said to have been the result of sorcery. There was no strenuous effort to trace the sorcerer, because knowledge of his identity would bring the obligation to exercise fatal punishment, which would involve trouble with the Administration.' <sup id="cite_ref-1114" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1114">[1,114]</a></sup> 'Retaliation by direct violence still takes place, although the Orokaiva are generally careful not to let it have a fatal result. If a woman is found to have committed adultery, her husband thrashes her. Traditionally, he has a right to take direct action against the co-respondent also, but nowadays he is more likely to tell his naname (friend), who calls the adulterer a series of uncomplimentary names in public and makes his position so intolerable that he will leave the village. The offender may go into the bush for a while, but generally he goes to some other village where he has a naname of his own who will give him shelter and hospitality.' <sup id="cite_ref-1115" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1115">[1,115]</a></sup> 'If a woman suspects her husband of adultery, she accuses him loudly in public, and if the husband cannot satisfy her that her suspicions are ill-founded, she will gather her few belongings in a string bag and set out for her own village. This act of the woman, while she is in a mood of righteous anger, is regarded as retaliation. “Now,” she cries as a parting shot, “you will have no one to cook for you!” Actually, it is not difficult for the man to find a friend's wife or some kinswoman to cook for him, but the routine of his life is upset.' <sup id="cite_ref-1116" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1116">[1,116]</a></sup> Homicide was curtailed by colonial regulations; victims resorted to leaving or self-injury with the intention of inducing shame in the culprit: 'Clearly, the sanction of retaliation is severely limited by the modern prohibition of killing, for it is necessarily somewhat abortive without the freedom to carry it through. Nowadays, the pattern is to leave the field rather than stay and fight it out. In domestic squabbles, either the guilty parties or the wronged ones who are unable to retaliate can leave the village until tempers have cooled. If arguments between segments of a village recur and seem to be developing into a feud, one section can break away to found a new village at a little distance from the first.' <sup id="cite_ref-1117" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1117">[1,117]</a></sup> 'Retaliation is impossible when crimes are carried out surreptitiously so that the crime is discovered but the criminal is not known. There remains the sanction of self-injury, which makes the wrongdoer feel sorry for the wronged one and therefore ashamed of having caused him to suffer. F. E. Williams cites two cases of theft which illustrate the operation of this peculiarly oblique sanction. To make the thief realize the enormity of his offence, the owner of a stolen watermelon hacked the rest of his crop to pieces, and the owner of a stolen spear chopped down his house where he had left the spear. The injured man aggravates his own injury, so that pity for him will induce shame in the culprit. This attitude on the part of the injured man is largely a blend of anger and self-pity. It is called sisira.' <sup id="cite_ref-1118" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1118">[1,118]</a></sup> 'This sanction demonstrates how the Orokaiva tends to take revenge upon the person who hurt his feelings by punishing himself. This is something of this self-punishing, too, in the wearing of the heratu (plant-emblem) as a symbol of abstention from food belonging to or prepared by someone who has wronged him.' <sup id="cite_ref-1119" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1119">[1,119]</a></sup> 'In conclusion, it could be said that the Orokaiva have a fairly weak system of social control. The sanctions against wrongdoing are all diffuse, and do not always work successfully. There seems to be a complete absence of any effective judicial system. A thief or a murdering sorcerer has to be caught in the act to be punished at all. There is no machinery for discovering the culprit. In a domestic crisis, a woman will “retaliate” by leaving her husband ostensibly with no one to cook for him, but it is easy for him to find someone willing to do his cooking. He does this by invoking pity. If a situation is unbearable, an individual can always leave the village. A woman can go to her kinsfolk, and a man to his naname's village.' <sup id="cite_ref-1120" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1120">[1,120]</a></sup> 'The only person an Orokaiva can punish effectively is himself. There seems to be a good deal of impotent rage in the destruction of a man's own property in a fit of sisira. Also, the wronged man is sorry for himself, and he ensures that everyone else, including the person who wronged him, feels sorry for him, too. The masochistic sanction of self-injury, with the purpose of invoking the criminal's pity, is in direct contrast to the outward aggression of the Orokaiva's traditional relations with the hostile Tagaho and Managalasi. It is possible that the weakness of the internal judicial system was originally due to the necessity for keeping overt aggression geared towards the enemy groups. To maintain constant warfare with outsiders, internal aggression had to be severely limited, even aggression towards wrongdoers. Hence, perhaps, the unwillingness to ferret out the culprit when a theft occurs or a person dies from sorcery, unless the criminal is actually caught in the act.' <sup id="cite_ref-1121" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1121">[1,121]</a></sup> Institutionalized friendshiep ties could both strengthen and impede social control: 'The relationship between institutionalized friendship and social control is ambiguous. A man's naname are his contemporaries who were secluded with him in the oro during his initiation, and other friends he may acquire later. Every man has many naname scattered throughout neighbouring and distant villages. Being somebody's naname constitutes a bond which overrides all other considerations. A man's loyalty to his naname is said to be stronger than his loyalty to his family and his relatives. Although, theoretically, a man who is otohu never quarrels and brawls, if he is involved in brawls in defence of a naname he is paradoxically judged to be more otohu than ever. So strong is the bond between naname that in fact men cannot conceive of committing offences against anyone who stands in this relationship to them. This attitude tends to be extended to friends of a man's naname, so normally there are very few people in the community who are potential victims of, say, a man's impulse to steal. Considered as an instrument of social control, institutionalized friendship minimizes the possibility of deviance.' <sup id="cite_ref-1122" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1122">[1,122]</a></sup> 'Formerly, the conduct of wars and cannibal raids was determined largely by this institution. The Koropata people who went to help their allies at Isivita in a [Page 118] war against the Managalasi were those who had friends at Isivita and those who were friends (naname) of men already committed by friendship to go. The conduct of warfare depended upon these personal links between naname, who had a binding obligation to fight for one another. The Wasida people still say of their traditional enemies (the Togaho, the Managalasi, and the Orokaiva of Sairope), “We have no friends among them.” Having no friends among them, and having no friends in common with them, they were free to fight.' <sup id="cite_ref-1123" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1123">[1,123]</a></sup> 'Institutionalized friendship also operates against social control, in regard to the consequences of wrongdoing. If a man is driven from his own village by shame for a wrong he has committed, he is welcomed by his naname, whose hospitality is always ready. It is impossible for a man to be a social outcast, as he can stay in his naname's village as long as he likes as a welcome and honoured guest.' <sup id="cite_ref-1124" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1124">[1,124]</a></sup> 'Therefore, social control amongst the Orokaiva is perhaps weaker than it is in the more formalized societies, because of the internal stresses imposed by constantly recurring warfare, and because also the efficient conduct of wars and cannibal raids involved the institutionalization of friendship to such a degree that it provides, even to-day, a loophole for the deviant. On the other hand, this institution itself tends to minimize the possibility of deviance by providing each man with a category of people towards whom it is inconceivable that he should act otherwise than in strict accordance with the otohu ideals.' <sup id="cite_ref-1125" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1125">[1,125]</a></sup> Colonial authorities introduced prisons and forced labour: 'Every able-bodied man between the ages of 16 and 36 years who lived within five miles of a plantation (except those employed by government, missions or European plantations) was required, by regulations under the ordinance, to work 60 [Page 12] days per year on the plantation of his village.

<p><b>State Intervention in Economy</b>
</p>
<dl><dd> <b>♠ The state regulates banking ♣ absent: 1884-1920 CE; present: 1921-1948 CE ♥</b> Note: Rural economies were dominated by subsistence horticulture: 'The household is the basic unit of production and consumption, with swidden horticulture as the subsistence base. The main crop is taro, which occupies about 90 percent of the cultivated land. A variety of other plants are grown as well, including bananas, sugarcane, edible PITPIT, and a few introduced cultigens such as pineapples, tomatoes, beans, and sweet potatoes. Although the Orokaiva traditionally tended coconut, sago, betel-nut, and a few other varieties of trees in gardens, villages, and in the bush, their arboriculture was rudimentary in comparison to their precise and detailed attention to tubers, especially taro. A good deal of plant and animal food is obtained by foraging, especially in the tropical rain forest that covers most of the Northern District. Foraged animal foods include grubs, frogs, snails, rats, and bush eggs. Foraged plant foods are valued during the dry season, when roots, leaves, and fern fronds make up part of a meal. Fish are an important resource, being used not only for consum ption but for trade. Hunting is less important; the usual quarry consists of small marsupials, birds, and pigs. Pigs, dogs, and fowl have been domesticated and each man has one or more small dogs that he uses for hunting but that are ultimately destined for the pot. Fowl are a useful source of meat, eggs, and feathers for decoration on headdresses, spears, etc. Domestic pigs are slowly disappearing from the villages, due to a government campaign to eliminate pig husbandry in an attempt to improve village hygiene.' <sup id="cite_ref-1128" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1128">[1,128]</a></sup> 'Cooperation among men is common during hunting and house-building. Cooperation of a total village is rare, but there are cooperative hunting and fishing expeditions. There is also a sharp sexual division of labor. Men hunt; prepare tools and equipment; make sago; plant all crops, both traditional (taro, yams, sweet potatoes) and introduced (rubber, coffee); maintain the yams and rubber; harvest rubber; and market coffee. Women cook, care for the sick, maintain the taro and sweet potatoes, harvest taro, and market root crops. Men and women both fish, build fences, collect firewood, maintain and harvest the coffee crop, and market rubber.' <sup id="cite_ref-1129" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1129">[1,129]</a></sup> 'In response to Australian pressure during the colonial period, rubber, coffee, and coconut palms for copra have been planted, providing the Orokaiva with a reliable and substantial cash income in recent years.' <sup id="cite_ref-1130" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1130">[1,130]</a></sup> Unskilled wage labour and cash cropping were introduced during the colonial period: 'As a result of early colonial force it was men who were to be that part of the social group compelled to wage labour or to grow cash crops. This fitted well with traditional organization in which men were absent through the political demands of warfare and feasting. However, it did extend the situation so that women were called upon to do more of those daily work tasks which had been seen as the role of men. Even if the reinforcing ideology of sexual complementarity had broken down, the new outside powers did nothing legally to temper the ultimate physical superiority of the males: there was no official repression of wife beating or construction of an alternative model of marriage in law. Hence there was nothing in the law of the new power to inhibit a man's reliance on his wife or sister for much of his subsistence. While men control household money there exists the potential for greater inequality between men and women. As money can be hidden in banks it has the potential to be stored and to accumulate for a longer period than traditional items and, more importantly, can then be exchanged for almost any other item, transactions made for profit being possible within the capitalist system. As the Melpa men say (Strathern 1979:544), ‘Money is too “strong a thing” to be left to women to manage’.' <sup id="cite_ref-1131" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1131">[1,131]</a></sup> The same is true for towns: 'The establishment of towns, unknown before the coming of Europeans, has forced an even more drastic adaptation than have the changes in rural areas. For a man to leave his village and go to work in the town means long separation from his family and from his kin, an experience unheard of in the past. Separation from his relatives means that he may be facing dangerous risks from the sorcery of foreigners in an unknown country. This is one reason why migrant workers tend to live in kin clusters in the towns. Unemployment, inadequate living quarters, low wages, the necessity for paying in cash for all goods and services, and the obligation to send cash gifts to relatives in the villages, all add to the town dwellers' difficulties.' <sup id="cite_ref-1132" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1132">[1,132]</a></sup> 'The small urban population lives for the most part in towns whose original location was determined either by access to a good harbour for early colonial planters or, in the interior, by the availability of level land sufficient for an airstrip. Despite the greatly diminished importance of plantations and the relocation of most of these airstrips out of the towns, those origins helped determine the existing urban layout. Port Moresby and Lae, on the Huon Gulf, are the largest cities.' <sup id="cite_ref-1133" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1133">[1,133]</a></sup> But most of the Orokaiva populaton remained rural during the colonial period. Some of the below variables may therefore not apply to the Orokaiva.*********According to SCCS variable 17 'Money (Media of Exchange) and Credit', ‘1’ or 'No media of exchange or money' was present, not 'Domestically used articles as media of exchange' or 'Tokens of conventional value as media of exchange' or 'Foreign coinage or paper coinage', or 'Indigenous coinage or paper currency'. The dates given in Newton's and Schwimmer's materials suggest that credit structures were introduced only after World War II and the eruption of Mt. Lamington: 'The Administration continued to promote economic development as well as to aid the rehabilitation of both Australian and Papua New Guinean ex-servicemen. Land bought by Australians immediately after the war was used in 1958 for a scheme to provide land and credit for ex-servicemen. The loans to the 131 Papuan and New Guinean servicemen totalled £112,550 whereas loans totalling £3,120,000 were given to 141 European ex-servicemen. The Europeans in the scheme had large 400-500 acre blocks of which there were twenty-nine in Northern Division, whereas the Papuans had small-holder blocks of 25 to 30 acres, of which there were seventy-eight in Northern Division (Howlett 1965:4, 5, 9, 56).' <sup id="cite_ref-1134" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1134">[1,134]</a></sup> 'Although there is provision in the Territory for credit assistance for economic development, small growers of cash crops such as are found in Sivepe and Inonda are not eligible for this credit. A short time before I left, one man from Inonda (again the government driver) was encouraged to apply for a loan under a new experimental scheme for beef cattle farming, but the arrangements were not complete when I left.' <sup id="cite_ref-1135" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1135">[1,135]</a></sup> But Crocombe and Hogbin describe a Native Loans Board: 'During the 1920's “communal” village plantations were established throughout the Orokaiva area under the Native Plantations Ordinance 1918. Part of the proceeds of produce sales was distributed to villagers and part was deposited in a fund to be used for specific purposes including education. The project was resumed for a short time after the war and a credit balance remained in the Sangara Native Coffee Trust Fund. This money was used as part payment for the purchase of hulling, winnowing and polishing machines for the factory. The balance was met by a loan from the Native Loans Board (which is an agency of the central government). A factory building was erected for the council by an indigenous contractor at a cost of £500. The building was completed and the machinery installed by January 1959. Until this time the processing and marketing of coffee had been undertaken by a private firm.' <sup id="cite_ref-1136" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1136">[1,136]</a></sup> We have adopted 1920 as a provisional date of transition.</dd>

Salt was occasionally used as a form of payment: 'Salt. The native shows the usual craving for salt, so that among the inlanders it is useful pay for carriers. Visiting the coast, these inlanders will even take calabashes and bring them home full of sea-water. The only means of obtaining it locally is by burning certain leaves and the husks of coco-nut or Tauga nuts. Over a layer of dry wood are set a number of large pottery fragments, and over these again are piled the leaves and husks. Ignited, the pile smokes abundantly, and when it has burnt away leaves a residue of [Page 65] ash in the pottery fragments. For actual use the ash, which has a salty taste, is placed in a half coco-nut shell and watered; and the salty water percolates through the eyehole of the coco-nut into the cooking-pot.' <sup id="cite_ref-1137" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1137">[1,137]</a></sup> Shell beads served as tokens of exchange in brideprice negotiations: 'Traditional valuables. The possession of hambo (bone and shell ornaments) and di (feather headdress) may give some indication of a man's adherence to traditional values. In traditional Orokaiva society the possession of such valuables demonstrated wealth and prowess, but this function is now being taken over by money, as the relative importance of cash as the means of procuring desirable products increases, and money transactions become more frequent. Hambo and di are inherited through the father and sometimes other relatives, and they are usually distributed among the surviving sons. It is difficult to assess the traditional valuables owned by any one individual, as a man often looks after his younger brothers' shares and more than one person, both within and without the nuclear family, may have rights to the hambo and di kept in a particular household.' <sup id="cite_ref-1138" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1138">[1,138]</a></sup> 'Traditional bridewealth exchanges in Papua New Guinea invariably incorporated important valuables symbolizing male and female qualities and duties, the linking of two kinship groups or family networks and so on. The modern stress on cash seems almost an obsession. Orokaiva brideprice includes traditional goods such as pigs and taro, and sometimes feather head-dresses and shell necklaces. But it is the cash component which dominates the aggressive demands and which becomes a focus of talk in the village.' <sup id="cite_ref-1139" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1139">[1,139]</a></sup> 'In the first case this was the exchange between man and woman in making their own contributions and deriving their own benefits in the taro garden - a cycle of exchange which parallels the cultivation cycle of the taro itself. In the second case it was the exchange between clansmen which is complete only when the man who received the brideprice provides recruits for the clan, as well as a steady new affinal alliance. It does not concern me here whether psychologists would, in such cases, accept the exchange breakdown as the real cause of the social breakdown; I have illustrated that the Orokaiva view social breakdowns in this manner.' <sup id="cite_ref-1140" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1140">[1,140]</a></sup> Monetary exchange was introduced by the colonial powers: 'By the 1930s many Koropata men had been to gaol for disobeying one or other of the Native Regulations. Tax had been introduced before World War I and the consequent need for money was a powerful impetus for the planting of village cash crops and continued signing on for plantation work. In this decade more Koropatans were recruited to work on Kokoda rubber plantations, thus coming into contact with other Papuans. More of the villagers were becoming familiar with Papuans from other areas. The mission was known only by rumour until 1928 when the Anglicans bought 5 acres at Baravaturu. During the 1930s the more mobile Koropatans became acquainted with a kind of white man whose activities and objectives seemed to differ from those they had previously encountered, the missionary more interested in their beliefs than their labour power (Files 407, Karius in 409, 411; Box 6549, G91).' <sup id="cite_ref-1141" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1141">[1,141]</a></sup> We are unsure whether 'guaranteed stability of coin value' was present, but have assumed so. A date of transition still needs to be identified.</dd>
<dd> <b>♠ Public markets ♣ present ♥</b> The foreign authorities established colonial settlements (see above), enabling trading relations with the Orokaiva population: 'European contact was to alter radically two major facets of pre-contact Orokaivan life. Forced pacification and compulsory labour would inhibit the scope of feasting and fighting. It would also open the path for the more regular association of different clans and tribes in the context of voluntary market exchange and government carrying and road work. This wider, peaceful association would modify the narrow moral universe. This was also to be challenged by the introduced missionaries, who would call on people to love all fellow humans.' <sup id="cite_ref-1142" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1142">[1,142]</a></sup> [Even in colonial settlements, services were of a makeshift character.] Given the introduction of cash-cropping, we have assumed that Orokaiva farmers visited colonial markets occasionally.</dd></dl>
<p><b>Contracts</b>

<dl><dd> <b>♠ State enforcement ♣ ♥</b> The colonial authorities enforced cash-cropping: 'Arboriculture. Although the Orokaiva traditionally planted coconut, betelnut and a few other trees in gardens, villages and in the bush, their arboriculture used to be rudimentary in comparison to their precise and detailed attention to tubers, especially taro. The Australian authorities had hardly established themselves in Papua before they began to press the population into extensive arboriculture that would yield a cash income. One of the early ‘native regulations’ (No. 121, passed in 1903), compelled all Papuan villages to grow a stipulated number of rubber trees. Three such rubber stands were established at Sivepe, ranging from one half to three acres in area, all village men supposedly sharing in the work. Rimoldi (1966: 86-93), who describes in detail the vicissitudes of exploitation of these trees, shows how ill-adapted communal rubber stands are to a society lacking institutions for the distribution of corporate assets to its members. Nonetheless, a further stand was established, this time quite voluntarily, in 1964. They are known as the ‘company trees’, have not yielded any cash, and will be discussed in detail below as the land transactions involved cast light on the ideology of contemporary Orokaiva co-operative movements.' <sup id="cite_ref-1143" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1143">[1,143]</a></sup> '‘Communal’ village plantations for coffee were established in the Northern District under the same regulations as applied to rubber, but all producing trees in the villages I visited had been grown on quasi-individual holdings. First plantings were around 1955. On a rough estimate I would say that the number of trees in Sivepe and Hohorita, two villages on the foothills, were 3,500 and 15,000, while Inonda, on alluvial plains, had 800. Coffee is one crop that [Page 23] actually has provided the Orokaiva with a reliable and substantial cash income for some years. This is true to a very minor extent for the third cash crop promoted on a major scale, copra, which was grown especially near the coast. The coffee is processed and sent to a co-operative factory as parchment, for which purpose many villages own one or more hullers.

A system of 99-year leases was introduced by the Australians in 1906, but land alienation was restricted in an effort to protect Papuans. Land bought from the Orokaivans or claimed as waste and vacant was leased to Europeans on condition that they made improvements. On such land several plantations were established in Northern Division.' <sup id="cite_ref-1147" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1147">[1,147]</a></sup> The colonial authorities also bought land for plantations: 'When the Papuan Act was passed in 1905 by the Australian Commonwealth Parliament, it provided a legal framework for the Australian Administration in the whole of the Territory, of which Northern Division was a part. Ordinances whose provisions had a particular relevance for Northern Division were those that imposed a tax and made cash cropping, carrying and roadbuilding compulsory.' <sup id="cite_ref-1148" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1148">[1,148]</a></sup> 'In spite of lobbying from Europeans, a tax on the indigenous population was not imposed until 1918 when a £2 head tax per annum on adult males was instituted (Griffin et al. 1979:23; Wolfers 1975:34, 37; PAR 1894:v, vii, viii).' <sup id="cite_ref-1149" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1149">[1,149]</a></sup> 'Cash cropping. The initial ordinance requiring villages to plant coconuts was passed in 1894, the intention being that the cash income would benefit the villages. Despite the fact that the planting of the communal stands was difficult to enforce and that the copra brought little cash return, by 1914 there were 10,000 planted palms in the Buna area. In 1918 the Native Plantation Ordinance set out more clearly new mechanisms of operation. In accordance with this, in 1921 the Crown started buying land for Native Plantations. Able-bodied men within 5 miles were required to work 60 days a year in lieu of tax. Failure to do so meant that they had to pay tax and, in addition, risk a fine or imprisonment. It was originally envisaged that the produce from the plantation would be divided between villagers and government but, in practice, the produce was sold and the money divided between the villagers and the government. The government's share was to be spent on works benefiting the Papuans. This part of the scheme was never fully implemented. Villagers' returns from the copra sales remained very small and occasionally they expressed their anger at this. Coffee planted under the scheme gave better returns and, by 1939, the areas planted with this cash crop around Higaturu were producing 84 tons of hulled coffee a year.' <sup id="cite_ref-1150" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1150">[1,150]</a></sup> 'In sum then, the mechanisms of pre-war colonialism included a compulsory tax, compulsory cashcropping, compulsory carrying and roadwork. Rewards consisted of tobacco, steel tools and cash, among other things. Results for village production were periods of enforced absence of men and, presumably, an increased efficiency in men's labour due to steel axes. Women's work continued without labour-saving devices and often without the help of the men. Food and labour came to be seen in certain extra-village contexts as a unit of value immediately repayable by another unit of value, such as tobacco or money.' <sup id="cite_ref-1151" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1151">[1,151]</a></sup> 'By the 1930s many Koropata men had been to gaol for disobeying one or other of the Native Regulations.

<p><b>♠ Food storage ♣ absent ♥</b> According to SCCS variable 20 'Food Storage' 'Individual households', not 'Communal facilities', 'Political agent controlled repositories', or 'Economic agent controlled repositories' were present, coded in the SCCS as ‘2’. Food  was usually stored by individuals, not in communal facilities. Roots and tubers were stored in yam-houses. [These were the property of individuals, usually men (though in some respects it might be more accurate to call them the property of married couple or households). Some yam houses had internal divisions such that the yams in different areas belonged to different persons, who were invariably related.] 'While time devoted to taro cultivation always exceeds that of the other two crops, harvesting falls off markedly during the dry season. In contrast, the time devoted to the harvesting of sweet potato increases steadily through the survey, while that of yams is confined almost entirely to the wet season when large quantities are stored in specially constructed yam houses (or occasionally in holes in the ground).' <sup id="cite_ref-1154" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1154">[1,154]</a></sup> 'The storing of yams is in the harau or yam-houses, seen commonly in many of the southern villages of the division. The harau usually takes the form of a small platform sheltered by a gabled roof in which there is a sort of attic. The platform is simply a place of social intercourse; the attic is the storehouse for yams. It is closed at either end, and thus dry and dark. When the yams are sprouting it is time for replanting.' <sup id="cite_ref-1155" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1155">[1,155]</a></sup> 'A mere roofless platform is sometimes to be seen as a place of social intercourse. Among the southern tribes it is more usually combined with the picturesque little harau or yam-house, in which a small attic compartment above is the repository for the sprouting yams.' <sup id="cite_ref-1156" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1156">[1,156]</a></sup> Other crops were accumulated for feasts: 'The fact that there is never real famine and that scarcity is a rare thing, brings about an attitude of mind which we might call improvidence. Yams are stored where they are grown; so also are Tauga nuts and Puga. But the two former are not common except in the south of the Division. Beyond these, and of course the coconut, the native puts by no vegetable food. When a feast is preparing, the taro will be gathered in great quantities and stacked on platforms. Some is eaten at the feast, some distributed with a great display of cordiality to the guests, who take it home. There is no method of preserving taro, and sometimes, when a feast is for any reason delayed, a great deal of food may deteriorate and become inedible.' <sup id="cite_ref-1157" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1157">[1,157]</a></sup>  'Coco-nuts are accumulated, under strict taboo, for a feast. The huge coco-nut-laden tripod in the centre of the village, or the long lines of dry nuts on the ground, indicate that there is some entertainment pending towards which all the villagers will contribute. Sometimes one may see the tragedy of a feast over-long delayed and the nuts sprouting head high, too far gone to eat and perhaps too far gone to plant.' <sup id="cite_ref-1158" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1158">[1,158]</a></sup> [The yams stored in yam houses were distinctly not constructed for the purpose of communal feasts only, but for feasts as well as general consumption. It was (and still is) usual for Orokaiva to plant special garden plots whose produce is earmarked for consumption or distribution at communal feasts, but the  main crop for that is taro, and usually the food is stored, basically, in the ground (it is left to continue "hardening" or "ripening" in the unharvested garden) until just several days before the feast will be held. There may be some regional variation involved, though.]

<p><b>♠ Drinking water ♣ absent ♥</b> The absence of irrigation systems suggests that drinking water was collected from streams nearby rather than supply systems: 'Very full data on the size of these gardens have been provided by Crocombe and Hogbin (1963) and Rimoldi (1966). A household tends to establish something like one and a half to two acres of garden per year. A garden is never used for more than one taro season, but as planting and consumption of the taro each tend to be stretched over most of a year, almost two years elapse between the clearing and final abandonment. This gives time for the bananas and sugar-cane to reach maturity too. Once a garden is abandoned, it is not used again for at least eight years or so. The usual swidden agriculture techniques are used, burning, clearing, careful removal of ‘rubbish’ remaining after the burning process, planting with a digging stick, periodic attention to weeding and heaping up of earth around growing taro, removal of corm-bearing bases of petioles of mature taro for removal and planting in a new garden. The Orokaiva practise no irrigation, no form of terracing or drainage, no manuring, no measures against parasites. Sometimes a fence is made out of tree trunks to keep pigs from breaking in. This is usually done only after a pig has made its first expedition, and only on the side where the pig entered.' <sup id="cite_ref-1159" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1159">[1,159]</a></sup> [Even in colonial settlements, services were of a makeshift character.]

<p><b>♠ Health infrastructure ♣ absent: 1884-1930 CE; present: 1931-1942 CE ♥</b> Illness was attributed to and cured by supernatural means: 'Illness and misfortune are attributed to the sprits of the dead, to the actions of sorcerers, or to natural causes such as an accident or the weather. Since illness is generally seen as caused by a foreign element entering the body, most cures used by curers (those who have SIVO, or special power and knowledge) are designed to extract the foreign element. These methods include producing noxious odors, rubbing the affected area, and extracting a foreign object by sucking.' <sup id="cite_ref-1161" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1161">[1,161]</a></sup> 'Orokaiva shamans, or "taro men" serve as healers, weather magicians, and sorcerers.' <sup id="cite_ref-1162" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1162">[1,162]</a></sup> Taro men and other ritual specialists were healers, among other things: 'A secondary activity of the Taro men is that of curing: the drumming and singing, or kasamba, is thought to be as efficacious for raising the sick as for raising the tubers in the garden. Their reputation as doctors, however, is somewhat marred, though not necessarily impaired, by the suspicion of sorcery. Still it is fair to say that this phase of their craft is not very pronounced.' <sup id="cite_ref-1163" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1163">[1,163]</a></sup> 'We have yet to see the Taro man in several subsidiary roles-those of doctor, weather-magician, and sorcerer. There is a tendency in primitive society for many distinct functions to be concentrated in one person of preeminence. [Page 57] When a man is credited with supernormal powers in any department of life, he becomes an object at once of admiration and suspicion; and he would be more of a fool than he is if he did not make full and varied use of this imputed supernormality. Consequently, if a man by virtue of spiritual possession can prosper the taro, he can cure the sick and control the weather by the same means; and, it is to be feared, he can turn his gift of mana to account in other and less amiable directions.' <sup id="cite_ref-1164" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1164">[1,164]</a></sup> 'In respect of medical treatment the Taro cult has brought with it a few innovations, though these have by no means displaced the older methods. The Taro man makes free use of old and new. There are, however, in native belief several distinct sources of infirmity, according to which all ailments may be roughly classified. There is, first, the mild epidemic (yevi or hauni) which is regarded as a phenomenon of nature, brought by the cold wind, and which usually evinces itself in a headache and a fever. There is, secondly, a large class of ailments due to the evil influence of spirits of the dead; these are commonly attended by internal pains. Thirdly, there are those illnesses caused by sorcery (kai, inja, saruka), which have a variety of more or less severe symptoms. Now the illnesses of this last category are in a sense incurable: there is only one recognized way of curing the victim of sorcery, and that is for the sorcerer himself to withdraw or annul his evil influence. A Taro man will not treat a case of sorcery-sickness: he acknowledges that he can do nothing for it, and he has a means of diagnosis which is as simple as it is infallible. He tries his treatments: if they are not successful, and the patient is obviously dying or already dead, he says, ‘I am sorry, I can do nothing: this is a case of sorcery-sickness.’' <sup id="cite_ref-1165" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1165">[1,165]</a></sup> 'As for the first category, those of the natural ailments, it appears that the Taro man will treat them with confidence, though they are said not to be fatal, and may be expected if left alone to cure themselves. It is with the [Page 58] second category, viz. those caused by the spirits, that the Taro doctor is best qualified to deal. That the spirits of the dead may afflict their surviving friends with illness is an old Orokaiva doctrine; that the spirits of the taro can do the same is presumably a new doctrine, associated only with the new cult.' <sup id="cite_ref-1166" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1166">[1,166]</a></sup> 'The methods of the doctor are in the main directed towards freeing the patient from the evil influence. The [Page 59] time-honoured practice of extracting the source of ailment in some material form, e.g. by sucking it out, is practised by the Orokaiva under the name of bara. As I propose to deal at greater length with native medicine in another report, I need not describe this operation here. While commonly performed by the Taro doctor, it is, of course, as a practice of world-wide distribution, long antecedent to the cult. Another process, that of humbari, or ‘taking’, is in universal use. This consists in massaging the patient toward the extremities of his limbs, with a peculiar plucking action. The masseur affects to be catching something from the patient's body and throwing it away. From time to time also he will blow violently into the finger-tips or into the ears, eyes, and nostrils of the sick man. This practice of humbari, I am led to understand, was, like that of bara, well known to the Orokaiva before the advent of the new cult. The fundamental idea once more seems to be that of casting out or extracting. Mr. Holland informs me that he has seen a Diroga man actually suck an open ulcer on another-an operation for which he received some payment and deserved it.' <sup id="cite_ref-1167" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1167">[1,167]</a></sup> 'The treatment, however, which is specially associated with the Taro cult is that of drum-beating. The friends of a sick man will invite a number of Taro men to attend him. There is the invariable feast and probably a large concourse of more or less solicitous guests. They gather about the house of sickness and unite their voices in the songs of the kasamba to the continual thumping of drums. The patient may even lie in the midst of the group. It is surprising that a man in high fever should not be utterly distracted by the noise; but it is said that a native likes unpleasant medicine: he puts more faith in it. Various explanations are given of the efficacy of the kasamba and the drum. Some said that as they made the taro ‘get up quickly’, so they would make the sick man ‘get up quickly’. Apparently it was considered merely an enlivening process. I am informed that one magistrate, being overtaken by the fever, submitted himself by way [Page 60] of experiment to the attentions of the Taro doctor and ‘got up quickly’. Others, pointing out that the drum should be held close to the patient, explained that the taro spirit was enticed out of his suffering body into the hollow of the drum. After this the doctor should go to the gardens and beat his drum again, when the spirit, being liberated, would return to the taro. On the whole, however, we may rest assured that the drum is beaten and believed to benefit the long-enduring patient without any searching inquiry on the part of the drummer as to how it does so.' <sup id="cite_ref-1168" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1168">[1,168]</a></sup> 'The Diroga men, with whom the spear is a symbol, use it also in the treatment of the sick. Dancing about the [Page 61] patient they thrust and withdraw quickly, or lay the spear point to his body and then snatch it away as if extracting something. Again, a Taro man may stroke the patient with Kandoro leaves (or other ba sivo) and then apply them to his own skin, or stick them in his armlet. The express explanation in this case was that the Taro man, through the medium of the taro medicine, was taking the ill-disposed spirit from the sick man back to himself, where it would do no harm.' <sup id="cite_ref-1169" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1169">[1,169]</a></sup> 'These methods of the doctor are reinforced by placatory offerings to the spirits. No uncommon sight is a spear driven into the ground before the door of a sick man and weighted with the valuable shell or boar's tusk ornaments which are the Orokaiva's wealth. These are offerings to the spirit who is causing the illness, and are meant to buy off his displeasure. They are set up commonly under directions from the Taro man, and in the event of a recovery they are likely to become his property. If the offerings be of no avail, however, and the patient should die, the Taro man is careful to explain that the ornaments are returned to his people.' <sup id="cite_ref-1170" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1170">[1,170]</a></sup> Christian missionaries established hospitals and provided some medical services: 'Hospitals and schools. The mission during this period seemed more detached from and independent of the Administration and commercial interests than it had been previously. However, structurally the mission became strongly tied to the Administration in the areas of medicine and education. The government encouraged such humanitarian activities as they improved relations between the colonized and colonizers but, lacking finance itself, was relieved that the mission took on most of the responsibility. So the Administration merely gave some financial subsidy and promoted the use of the growing mission services. Government reports in 1909 stated that twenty-four schools were operating in the Northern Division. The first mission hospital was established at Buna in 1913. In 1930, medical services were provided at six other small mission stations: Eroro, Sangara, Duvira, Gona, Isivita and Ambasi (see Fig. 2.4 and Wetherell 1977:241, 276, 311; Feetham 1917:13, 15; Shevill 1949:112, 110).' <sup id="cite_ref-1171" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1171">[1,171]</a></sup> Health services were improved after WW II: 'The incidence of wounding, starvation, and some illnesses such as dysentery (Army File 5/3/167) increased during the war, but ANGAU's establishment of hospitals laid the foundation for improved health services after the war. The military administration took over responsibility for the health of the local population and this was no longer the exclusive preserve of the missions. Between 1943 and 1945, 82,547 Papua New Guineans were treated by Army medical patrols and 116,588 were admitted to hospitals. The greatly increased scale of medical care is illustrated by the fact that there were four hospitals in Papua before the war and twenty-three after. The four before had twelve European staff, and the twenty-three after had sixty-one. In addition, the number [Page 48] of Native Medical Orderlies increased from 47 to 350 (Army Files 285/1/680A).' <sup id="cite_ref-1172" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1172">[1,172]</a></sup> We have adopted 1930 as a provisional date of transition.

<p><b>♠ State pensions for elites ♣ absent ♥</b> The colonial administration initially struggled to extend its reach to the interior: 'Armed clashes and the threat of use of violence were, of course, not effective means of achieving pacification. Government, commerce and the missionaries all used gift-giving as a method of establishing some kind of modus vivendi with the local people. The missionaries were most likely to handle threatening situations by giving goods such as cloth, iron, tobacco, beads and mirrors. They lamented that their Christian message was taken by the people as secondary to their provision of medical aid and goods. The Administration also made some use of the giving of gifts as a placatory technique. MacGregor and Monckton used presents suspended on trees or left on paths to avert trouble. However, in riskier situations, government officers would not hesitate to use firearms (Cecil King 1934:13; Chignell 1911:6, 140, 226; Wetherell 1977:32, 159).' <sup id="cite_ref-1173" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1173">[1,173]</a></sup> Village constables were installed as intermediaries: 'Village Constables. The suppression by force which had marked the early contact phase gave way to a form of ‘indirect rule’ through the appointment of Village Constables. The earliest Village Constables were the strong, leading men who had confronted the Europeans as warriors. As time passed war leaders were no longer a feature of the society, but patrol reports indicate that by and large Village Constables were influential and effective in the maintenance of law and order. The position of Village Constables was an uncomfortable and interstitial one. They had the difficult task of attempting to juggle the interests of their relatives and exchange partners and of the Administration, so that both sides were reasonably happy most of the time. Between 1907 and 1914 the number of Village Constables in the Northern Division rose from fifty-four to eighty-three, indicating that this system of administration was satisfactory to the Australian authorities. The Village Constables were concerned with enforcing legislation which impinged upon many aspects of daily life: burial of the dead, upkeep of roads, construction of latrines, neatness of houses and so on. Failure to obey these regulations could lead to imprisonment.' <sup id="cite_ref-1174" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1174">[1,174]</a></sup> 'Patrol reports from 1915 to the 1920s note regular satisfactory reporting by the Village Constables despite variations in the standard of housing, village cleanliness and road maintenance. Occasionally police would have to deal with disobedience against the colonial authority. In some cases the non-compliance stemmed from confusion about changed regulations but at other times the people deliberately avoided their obligations to carry for the government. In 1918 the Koropatan Village Constable enquired if carrying was still to be compulsory. He was probably confused following rumours of new legislation on carrying conditions. In 1919 and 1924 men in the area ran away when requested to carry (Bowden, 423, 6550, G91; Baker, 3995, 6548, G91; Flint, 402, 6549, G91).' <sup id="cite_ref-1175" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1175">[1,175]</a></sup> 'At the time of the eruption, a certain number of new roles had already become firmly established among Papuans: member of the Royal Papuan Constabulary, Village Constable, Mission Teacher, Medical Orderly, Clerk, Labourer. Post-war government policy aimed at greatly increasing the number and scope of these roles, both by [Page 56] instituting numerous training programmes for the development of skills hitherto unknown to Papuans, and by setting up organisations in which Papuans wield a limited amount of political and administrative responsibility. It suffices, for my present purpose, to enumerate modern roles, performed by Papuans, with which the people of Sivepe came into contact during the year of my field study.' <sup id="cite_ref-1176" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1176">[1,176]</a></sup> Government Councils later replaced ad hoc administration by individual officials: 'The Government, keen now to develop a prosperous and loyal colony for defence purposes, no longer used coercion in the establishment of cash crops. They strongly encouraged such activity, but in the context of individual plots as anything co-operative or communal smacked of communism (Schwimmer 1969:86). They promoted coffee and cocoa by promising large, individual returns. The new Local Government Councils became the agencies of the Administration to promote land-tenure conversion and the planting of coffee and Malayan rubber on the individual blocks created (Waddell &amp; Krinks 1968:15; Healey 1961:490; Jinks 1968:31, 28; Griffin, Nelson &amp; Firth 1979:123).' <sup id="cite_ref-1177" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1177">[1,177]</a></sup> Village Constables were paid by the colonial administration: 'In response to Australian pressure, the British government annexed Papua in 1888. Gold was discovered shortly thereafter, resulting in a major movement of prospectors and miners to what was then the Northern District. Relations with the Papuans were bad from the start, and there were numerous killings on both sides. The Protectorate of British New Guinea became Australian territory by the passing of the Papua Act of 1905 by the Commonwealth Government of Australia. The new administration adopted a policy of peaceful penetration, and many measures of social and economic national development were introduced. Local control was in the hands of village constables, paid servants of the Crown. Chosen by European officers, they were intermediaries between the government and the people. In 1951 an eruption occurred on Mount Lamington, completely devastating a large part of the area occupied by the Orokaiva.' <sup id="cite_ref-1178" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1178">[1,178]</a></sup> It is unclear from these text passages whether pensions were paid to constables. We have assumed this was not the case for the time being, but this is open to review. British and Australian officers probably received pensions.

<p><b>♠ Funding for festivals ♣ absent ♥</b> Until the early colonial period, Orokaiva groups celebrated the return of warriors after successful raids with a feast: 'When the victorious raiders returned they announced their success from afar off by a distinctive rhythm on the hui which (according to Aiga informants) may be represented thus:__ __ _ __, __ __ _ __ __.' <sup id="cite_ref-1179" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1179">[1,179]</a></sup>//'There were conventional songs proper to the occasion, such as (an Aiga example), Eruga tune kambaja-one Eruga [leaf   seasoning] Isuga tune   Kambaja-one Isuga [leaf   seasoning] by which the women were given to understand that they should prepare ‘cabbage’ for the cooking; or (a Sangara example) Umo tihue kiari-ta koiko-ta, which indicated that the enemy had fled (koiko), anxious to see (kiari) the familiar place where they drew water (umo [Page 172] tihu). The men who had not themselves secured victims would sing (another Sangara example), U sina nane arako, u sina nane, ‘Mine was like a water-fight’, by which they meant that they had fought as ineffectually as children bathing and splashing one another with water.' <sup id="cite_ref-1180" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1180">[1,180]</a></sup>//'Brought home by the raiders the corpse of the victim was set upright in the village, still attached to its pole. During the night there was dancing to the accompaniment of hui and drum-properly the largest and most old-fashioned of the drums, viz. the ino. In the morning the body was taken down to the stream and cut up in the running water, in order, as I was told, to wash away the blood. Various portions were distributed as they are in the case of a pig, and little odds and ends were given to the children, who played at roasting them in the fires. It was formerly the custom, I understand, to set up skulls of victims on a gaga or small platform in the village, just as pig-jaws are to be seen nowadays ranged along a branch of an old croton scrub. The pig-jaws are mainly in the nature of trophies, though it is said that to throw them away and lose sight of them would have an ill effect on hunting thereafter. I cannot say what were the motives for keeping human skulls, but presumably the same reasons would hold good.' <sup id="cite_ref-1181" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1181">[1,181]</a></sup> Big Men sponsored pig sacrifices and feasts in order to affirm mutual obligations and alliances. Pig Feasts and Sacrifices confirmed obligations through acts of generosity: 'Perhaps the most characteristic of them all is liberality. The liberal man is handembo, the word hande meaning distribution, or especially the sharing out of food. It is easy to understand how this should be a popular virtue, for the Orokaiva, like other natives, are much addicted to the making of feasts-and not because of a merely gluttonous appetite, as some who know least about natives have supposed, but more because of the glamour and the excitement of a social gathering. It is true we cannot acquit the handembo of a certain motive of self-display; for there is nothing, not valour in war nor prowess in the chase, that brings an Orokaiva so prominently into the public eye as the providing of a big feast.' <sup id="cite_ref-1182" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1182">[1,182]</a></sup>//Feasts could be very costly and required a long period of preparation: 'There is little to say concerning the harvesting. A woman gathers from time to time enough for her family's immediate wants, and the taro tops will be replanted. There are thus a number of plots at different stages of advancement in every woman's garden. Sometimes, however, when all the gardens of a clan are well stocked, there will be a simultaneous harvesting to furnish forth a feast. The products of the garden are then loaded ostentatiously upon platforms in the village before their final distribution to the guests.' <sup id="cite_ref-1183" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1183">[1,183]</a></sup>//Schwimmer reports the construction of feast-houses: 'The house in which the parents floated away must be understood as the prototype of the feast house. This is a small structure placed at one end of the central plaza (araha) of a village. It is built a few weeks before the feast and it is in front of and in the feast house that rituals are performed during the whole of the period that ceremonies last. We may take it that Jomiko and Sirere are [Page 54] demigods who are believed to have stablished the institution of building a feast house. As this couple were in the feast house during the fight, it may be assumed that they were, in a ritual sense, the feast-givers. A modern feast also always has a person occupying the office of feast leader who is charged with the ritual as well as the organisational tasks of the feast. This leader (pondo kiari embo) is a man acting alone, and there is no mention that his wife has any function. This is a curious discrepancy between myth and custom, especially as elsewhere in New Guinea the feast-givers are often an elderly couple (e.g. Landtman 1927).' <sup id="cite_ref-1184" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1184">[1,184]</a></sup>//Large feasts featured pig sacrifices: 'The pig is carried in the usual manner, with its feet bound to a pole. For a long journey a pig-litter (kakate) may be used. It is a cage-like structure of cane which, as it were, is made to measure and fits closely about the animal's body (see p. 79). The conventional method of slaughtering is with the spear, and at a feast of importance this is done ceremonially, a number of pigs being set in a row and stuck simultaneously. On such an occasion I have seen one of the butchers, more elderly than the rest, fail to impart sufficient force to his thrust, and try again, amid a good deal of laughter, until he drove the point home. Then he levered the shaft of his weapon back and forth like a crow-bar to make his work the surer. On the whole, however, there is no special inhumanity in the treatment of pigs.' <sup id="cite_ref-1185" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1185">[1,185]</a></sup> 'The actual butchering is performed on a platform. Two long incisions are made from shoulder to tail, and the skin cut off together with a thick coating of fat. Then the body is dismembered with axe, trade knife, and bamboo knife (the last-named, ivi, is still used because of its extraordinary sharpness). The carving is not a pleasing spectacle. The blood drips through between the rails of the platform and is eagerly lapped up by quarrelling dogs below. There may [Page 62] be some delay in the distribution of the meat, and then the scene of the feast becomes a veritable shambles. There is little squeamishness with the native, however, and even the entrails are not despised. As it was explained (whether naïvely or waggishly) on one occasion, fresh entrails are suitable for men; if they stink a little they are suitable for women; and if they stink a great deal they will do for the children.' <sup id="cite_ref-1186" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1186">[1,186]</a></sup> 'The pig sacrifice at this meeting serves to remove any latent hostility between the men of the group, so that all will be united and co-operate unreservedly towards the success of the feast. Though the pondo kiari embo tends to be a man of much influence in the village, he does not normally have any authority over resources held by any extended family other than his own. It is only for the specific purpose of feast-giving that he is given such authority, and it is limited in time from the meeting just described until the day of the feast itself. The meeting thus temporarily changes the authority structure of the village. The growing taro crop and the available pigs become, at least ideally, the corporate property of the village, whereas normally they are family property. The pondo kiari embo becomes, at least formally and ritually, the controller of this property. The unit of the group of offerers of the sacrifice is a necessary condition for the success of the rituals that follow.' <sup id="cite_ref-1187" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1187">[1,187]</a></sup>//Feasts featured the formal redistribution of food among hosts and guests: 'Towards the end of the day comes the formal distribution of food. The master of the feast, conferring anxiously with his friends, has been setting out the taro in heaps, making them correspond by laborious arithmetic with the number of his principal guests. Now that the tally appears satisfactory, he turns, with an enthusiasm bordering on violence, to the distribution. With loud shouts he and his assistants rush back and forth depositing, or often rather hurling down, bunches of taro before the guests, who accept them with a fitting appearance of indifference. In the same way the pig flesh-legs, quarters, chines, and entrails-are bestowed on top of the taro heaps, and the guests are ready to depart. They have been sufficiently regaled throughout the day; the food thus finally distributed is to be carried home. The women pack it into their string bags and prepare to move off. Men and children will bear their part. One remembers the spectacle of a diminutive child bearing away the blood-spattered head of a huge pig, balanced with difficulty and pride upon his own small crown. Thus laden with proofs of friendship the guests depart to await the time when, in a year or so, they will make a similar return of hospitality.' <sup id="cite_ref-1188" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1188">[1,188]</a></sup>//Feasts were held on multiple occasions: 'In pre-European times, according to present-day informants, the most important feasts held by the Orokaiva people were associated with initiation, marriage, death (though apparently not birth), and the enhancement of prestige. Feasts were also held to mark the transfer of land, the re-establishment of peace between persons who had been quarrelling, resumption of residence after a prolonged absence, and the lifting of prohibitions between a man and his mother-in-law.' <sup id="cite_ref-1189" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1189">[1,189]</a></sup>//There may have been considerable change in the scale and types of feasts celebrated in the colonial period: 'It is impossible to know with any certainty the scale of feasting prior to European contact for, though a detailed study of these people was made in the late 1920s (Williams 1928 and 1930). Government patrols had brought tribal fighting to a halt some years before. It is therefore quite likely that, with less time taken up in warfare and greater freedom of movement assured, the feasts and ceremonies of that day were more elaborate than those of the precontact era.' <sup id="cite_ref-1190" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1190">[1,190]</a></sup>//Williams reports ritualized declarations of loyalty, but also claims that underlying wariness between guests and hosts was common: 'Again all the underlings of any ‘big man’ will be known to others under his name. In the Sangara dialect there is a word tekahoka, of which I do not know the literal meaning, but which appears to stand for a ‘following’. When, at a gathering of the clans for war, or for some peaceful ceremony, [Page 104] the several parties make their appearance each following in single file behind its leader, a cry will go up, ‘Here come the people, the Tekahoka, of Embuja, of Ehari, of Andari!’-whoever the big man may be. So in the Aiga language there is a word ambotani, which embraces all a man's junior relatives; and thus a number of more or less unimportant individuals may be known to others as the juniors of a certain big man and identified by his name.' <sup id="cite_ref-1191" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1191">[1,191]</a></sup> 'Treachery, of which one or two examples have been given (pp. 166-7), was not regarded as contemptible, and according to Beaver, as we have seen, one kind of homicidal emblem was specially assigned to the slayer of a peace emissary. Towards all outsiders the correct attitude was one of suspicion if not always of hostility; a complete stranger wandering alone would be regarded both as potential enemy and good meat; and when visitors came in friendship, as at a feast, there was never any lack of warlike readiness on either side. The very cries of welcome which are so characteristic of the Orokaiva are possibly a sign of the dormant hostility between guest and host, being recognizable in one case at least as meant for reassurance of the former regarding the intentions of the latter.' <sup id="cite_ref-1192" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1192">[1,192]</a></sup> Resources were provided by big men and community members rather than by 'third-party' institutions or through 'public' funding.

We may assume that the tabu is on the village and that it will remain until the occasion of the feast. If this feast is to be a considerable one, the first step will be the construction of an arijo, i.e. a men's house, which will be frequented by the men alone, and used for singing. This may be built a month or so before the festival, and from time to time the old-fashioned dancing (kuru) will take place in the open space before the arijo.' <sup id="cite_ref-1193" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1193">[1,193]</a></sup> Villagers erected tabu posts and performed dances in open spaces: 'Of the three main uses of the heratu previously described, viz. (1) as an identity token, (2) as a mark of individual abstinence, (3) as the naterari, or village tabu post, the last will seem tolerably clear. The naterari stands as a symbol of the dead man in whose behalf the tabu is imposed. Formerly it may have been something more than a formal symbol of the dead, in fact a crude image. This association between the wooden post and the dead man which it represents is strengthened by using his particular namesake tree: then, besides other associations, the two have this important bond between them-a common name.' <sup id="cite_ref-1194" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1194">[1,194]</a></sup> 'In most instances the houses are set in two regular rows, facing one another. The space between, sporadically planted with coco-nut palms, is the scene of dances, plays, and intervillage scuffles. The old-fashioned house has been for the most part replaced by the ‘European’ model. This does not always mean any great change, save that the new house is loftier and airier and frequently possesses an annexe or ‘kitchen’ which seems as a rule to serve any purpose but a culinary one. But the general improvement is undeniable. The true native dwellings of the Orokaiva were so poor that W. E. Armit, an early resident magistrate, described them as ‘miserable little things, small ramshackle erections’, and referred to an Opi village as ‘a collection of squalid hovels’.' <sup id="cite_ref-1195" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1195">[1,195]</a></sup> Other structures are erected for initiates and taro men: 'Seclusion is practised by all the tribes, north and south; and it appears that the same general rules are observed in all cases. The house of seclusion, removed a little distance from the village, stands in a small enclosure (sama) fenced about with palm-leaf barriers some thirteen or fourteen feet in height. The house is called oro (Aiga) and may in some instances, I am told, accommodate both boy and girl candidates; for it is said that they are all ‘brothers and sisters’ and may, therefore, be trusted to behave. Usually, however, those who arrange the matter are less trusting, and the two sexes are confined separately. One house of seclusion which I saw was about 9 feet by 15 feet in area and consisted of a single large room in which nine boys were confined. The house was closed in on all sides and the eyes of the inmates seemed very wide in the perpetual semi-darkness. The secluded children are called i-tekari-mei, ‘The children who are shut up above’, or simply i-mei, ‘the on-top children’. They occupy the upper part of a pile house, the actual ground floor of which is used by the old men who [Page 185] look after them. They discard all ornaments, but it seems, nowadays at least, to be a matter of indifference whether or no they wear a bo. They must not wash, and it is said to be the proper thing to keep the house warm by a fire underneath; though this, I believe, is not meant as a trial to the initiates, but rather to make them comfortable. Whenever they please they may exercise themselves in the sama enclosure, and occasionally they go farther afield in the bush.' <sup id="cite_ref-1196" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1196">[1,196]</a></sup> 'Possibly a special platform or house, a sort of bandstand, has been erected for the occasion. This is called ba oro, i.e. ‘Taro men's house’, and is meant for the somewhat exclusive use of the accredited Taro men during the day, and for the chorus which is to continue throughout the night. The singers will crowd about a fire in the centre of the floor; if the night be cold, they will sit more comfortably in the ascending heat of fires on the ground beneath. One man after another leads, singing a stave or two with the truly musical voice of the Orokaiva, and as, or almost before, he finishes, the whole chorus bursts forth with the refrain. The drums beat the distinctive Taro rhythm, viz. two equal beats followed by a pause equivalent to one of them, or time of three with the third beat missed. This rhythm, I believe, is used throughout the whole Division by the Taro singers, and, as far as I know, exclusively. It is the same rhythm as that of the dance baruga, practised long previous to the advent of Taro, save that it is considerably slower. According to one informant, the Taro measure had been specified, like other details of the cult, in a dream. The drums are tuned with no little care, the lizard skin being tautened with lumps of beeswax until the correct tone is obtained. Shell trumpets are blown by one or two boys, whose enthusiasm is not unequal to the immense staying power which this instrument demands; but too often the shell trumpet, which admits of no tuning, shatters the harmony of the concert, and one can understand why a distracted missionary lit his Primus stove and placed it by his reading-lamp so that its roar might drown the discords of the kasamba.' <sup id="cite_ref-1197" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1197">[1,197]</a></sup> We have provisionally coded 'present', but this is open to review.</dd>

The songs-like so many native songs, unintelligible alike to the listener and the singers-would often appear to be, in their origin, exhortations or hymns of praise to the taro. Certain sects perform distinctive dances, but, except in a few instances, the dance has not been highly elaborated, and remains a minor feature of the cult. Perhaps as an unintentional substitute, the innumerable followers of the movement indulged in various kinds of foolish antics, with reeling, staggering, and a violent shaking of the head and limbs known as jipari. There was no attempt to control these actions-rather the contrary-and they commonly ended in mild contortions and paroxysms. Such uncontrolled bodily movements do not belong to the Taro cult alone, but have been a common and unpleasant feature of many of the new religious movements enumerated above.' <sup id="cite_ref-1199" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1199">[1,199]</a></sup> 'Now they beat their drums and begin to dance. Buninia slowly rises, looks in astonishment at the gay figures before him, and then, suddenly shouting ‘Ba, ba, ba, ba!’ rushes into the dance. The movements closely resemble those of the conventional Orokaiva ballet. The young men, dancing two by two, move gracefully and with that appearance of power which is so admirable a feature of the northern dance; while Buninia, a doddering old man, his person gaily decorated with coloured and scented leaves, whirls swiftly through and around the couples, still shouting his ‘Ba, ba, ba!’ When the dance is finished the taro spirits deposit their bundles in a heap and retire. The dream is ended and Buninia (somewhat blown by his exertions) awakes, calls his friends around him, and proceeds to distribute the taro which the spirits have left behind.' <sup id="cite_ref-1200" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1200">[1,200]</a></sup> 'In the first day's demonstration Kove the village policeman was almost alone and quite overshadowed, especially by the young and enthusiastic recruits of Diroga.

On the morrow, he declared, there would be a ‘race’, i.e. a competition, to see who danced longer and better, and who were the more numerous.' <sup id="cite_ref-1201" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1201">[1,201]</a></sup> 'At about noon next day Kove's party, heavily reinforced, [Page 20] made its appearance to the sound of drums and conches and their own lusty voices, and took up their stand at one end of the village. The accredited Kivere men formed the front rank; behind them were the drummers and singers, mere laymen; and behind these again a number of girls made use of the opportunity for displaying their charms in a dance.' <sup id="cite_ref-1202" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1202">[1,202]</a></sup> 'The Kivere men carry spears. Gripping them tightly they reel, shudder, and posture, the spear struck into the ground seeming to act as some support, while their faces assume expressions of great agony, which, one sincerely hopes, are largely counterfeit. For the most part they remain stationary, though occasionally an individual will break away, and brandishing his spear, and swerving in and out among spectators and coco-nut palms, perform a frantic, staggering circle back to his place in the rank.' <sup id="cite_ref-1203" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1203">[1,203]</a></sup> 'While these demonstrations of the power of the spirit are continuing, the arrival of the Diroga men is awaited from the other end of the village. This rival party has been preparing its paint and feathers and characteristic decoration of flowers or leaves, and has been practising assiduously the steps of the Diroga dance. Now, headed by two old adepts (both interpreters of mine who hail from the district where Diroga is in vogue), the new converts advance in open formation toward the waiting Kivere men. Their movements are full of grace: they progress at once rapidly and slowly, bounding forward a few yards and then retreating almost as far again. There are definite steps to be performed but no complicated movements; each dancer moves individually, dodging, gliding, or leaping; there is no voice heard save an occasional half-stifled ejaculation, a sort of whimper which the Diroga men affect; but every movement is accompanied by a thrust or jab of the slender spear, and the hollow rattles which are attached to it maintain a queer accompaniment. Resembling most a force in attack, the Diroga party was much more mobile than the usually solid phalanx of the Kivere men; their [Page 21] conduct had much more of art in it, and fewer real excesses. Considering that they were mostly novices their performance certainly did them credit. Foremost among them, and evidently very conscious of his own address, was my newly converted cook-boy, who danced far better than he cooked.' <sup id="cite_ref-1204" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1204">[1,204]</a></sup> 'While these two parties were in a manner dancing one another down, the Kaiva men, though less strongly represented, were not idle. Old Tevara, head of the faction from the Kumusi, carried a magnificent spear, very weighty, and beautifully polished and feathered. This he manipulated as if in a pole dance, and performed graceful little pirouettes with his feet, all of which, to one's surprise, cost him no loss of dignity, although he was an elderly man and a very large one. Circling in and out among the bystanders he would pause from time to time to hold his spear horizontally above their heads, in a manner reminiscent of benediction. Prominent among his followers was his wife, whose movements had more velocity if less elegance, and who continually flicked the spectators with a bunch of the crimson-leafed taro medicine, Tumeni.' <sup id="cite_ref-1205" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1205">[1,205]</a></sup> 'The local faction of Kaiva men had their main representative in Siavije, who, trotting aimlessly hither and thither between the several parties of dancers, and repeating something over and over to himself, acted a part all his own which, it is to be feared, made no great impression on the bystanders.' <sup id="cite_ref-1206" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1206">[1,206]</a></sup> 'After the dances, antics, or paroxysms of the several sects had continued for some time, there followed a general pause in which the Korisata people, forming themselves into single file, paraded past the visitors, each man shaking the hand of every visitor in turn as he passed. Then one of the leaders of the Diroga delivered a harangue before Kove's party of Kivere men. Prancing back and forth before them and menacing them with his spear, after the manner of an Orokaiva who wishes to make his voice heard, he explained the methods of Diroga, and bade them [Page 22] take no offence at the swift and warlike movements which were so different from their own. Kove's party listened with great attention, punctuating the speech with tattoos on their drums and with the deep-toned cry, uttered simultaneously by all, and resembling a kind of hoot, which is the Orokaiva equivalent for ‘hear, hear!’ or ‘Amen’. Kove the village constable made his address in reply, first insisting on a general silence, which he considered due to his status and uniform, and after that the hosts and guests, mutually satisfied, mingled and fell to upon the real taro.' <sup id="cite_ref-1207" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1207">[1,207]</a></sup>

Speaking of the Orokaivan Sivepe people, Schwimmer has noted that a gift of pig meat restores relations after a quarrel, and establishes new social relations. He suggests that pig sacrifice can be seen as communion with primeval ancestral beings (Schwimmer 1973:138-9, 145, 148, 153). In Koropata too the gift of pig meat can be used to emphasize the strength and importance of a particular social relationship. The creation myth told by Koropatans is centred on Totoima, a pig-man figure with long teeth (cf. Schwimmer 1973:55). His death and subsequent division into pieces represents the origin of the different language groups around the Orokaiva area. There are examples of pig-man association in myth, ritual and exchange throughout Melanesia.

While before the war, only a small minority had school education, the Anglican Mission spread its operations to several new stations, including Sasembata, after the war. After the eruption, the scope of education was again greatly extended and it could be said that the eruption marked the beginning of universal school education in the majority of Orokaiva villages. The Sasembata station began to draw virtually the entire child population of the surrounding villages, and most students now follow a five or six year course. While this development had been planned ever since the war, it may be significant that regular school attendance of all the villages in the district was experienced for the first time at Ilimo, where a school was conducted for the whole evacuee child population, and adult classes as well. It is the objective of present school programmes, as far as I can see, to make the population literate and the increase of literacy is a major aspect of acculturation over the period. Literacy has certainly progressed to a point where letters written in Orokaiva to any family in Sivepe can be read and understood with the help of at least a junior member of the family; and can be replied to. While I could see no evidence that people have acquired mathematical knowledge of any sophistication, I was struck by a strong quantitative orientation. In the Orokaiva language, there are no numerals higher than 2; hence, it is the invariable practise to use English numerals when speaking the Orokaiva language. The numerals are, in fact, among the main English linquistic features that have been borrowed. They are used with remarkable frequency; the number of coffee trees, the value in pounds of trade goods included in a bride price, the calculation of money prices, even the number of brothers or men who together played some role in a mythological tale (a distinctly contemporary touch, this)-all these phenomena show that “numbers” have become an integral part of Orokaiva culture. The Orokaiva use the English word “number” for a variety of quantitative concepts, including price. Finally, one must regard as an aspect of acculturation, the introduction of many [Page 80] concepts drawn from the scene of world affairs. While among the Orokaiva, I heard talk about Vietnam, Indonesia, Africa, India. The political orientation displayed was a mild kind of nationalism, and a sense of closeness to newly independent non-white states. But the information, derived from radio broadcasts and speeches by councillors, introduced an acculturative kind of perspective. Its dissemination is being actively encouraged by the Australian authorities.' <sup id="cite_ref-1218" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1218">[1,218]</a></sup> [Even in colonial settlements, services were of a makeshift character.] We have adopted 1900 as a provisional date of transition, but this is open to review.</dd></dl>

The ability of adults to undergo sustained periods of hard work, either in employment or in such subsistence tasks as sago-making, suggests that diet does not impose serious limitations on their productive capacity. It is worth noting, however, that there is a marked falling off in the level of activity in Sivepe during the dry season at a time when the diet, heavily reliant on sago, is least satisfactory. Moreover, this coincides with the coffee flush.' <sup id="cite_ref-1224" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1224">[1,224]</a></sup></dd></dl>

<p><b>♠ Volunteering ♣ absent ♥</b>
</p><p><b>♠ Charity ♣ absent ♥</b> Mutual aid and labour exchange were common: 'Cooperation among men is common during hunting and house-building. Cooperation of a total village is rare, but there are cooperative hunting and fishing expeditions. There is also a sharp sexual division of labor. Men hunt; prepare tools and equipment; make sago; plant all crops, both traditional (taro, yams, sweet potatoes) and introduced (rubber, coffee); maintain the yams and rubber; harvest rubber; and market coffee. Women cook, care for the sick, maintain the taro and sweet potatoes, harvest taro, and market root crops. Men and women both fish, build fences, collect firewood, maintain and harvest the coffee crop, and market rubber.' <sup id="cite_ref-1229" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1229">[1,229]</a></sup> 'Canoes. The canoe (ma) is a hollowed log with a platform and an outrigger. The work of obtaining a suitable log and the rough hewing of it will call for the assistance of a man's fellow villagers, for which he makes them no reward except that of feeding them. After the initial stages he works leisurely at it himself; he gives a neat finish to the hewing with his adze (and sometimes still the old stone adze is preferred for canoe work); he fits the platform and outrigger; [Page 74] and finally paints the dugout a dull red with ochre or clay, possibly picking out a zigzag in black at prow and stern. The craft is launched with no ceremony save a ‘trial spin’, and may or may not be given a personal name.' <sup id="cite_ref-1230" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1230">[1,230]</a></sup> 'While the Orokaiva family is obliged to support itself, and is in the ordinary round of life a working unit, we find numerous instances of a wider co-operation. Such co-operation is seen especially in the earlier stages of gardening, in fencing, in sago-making, and in the hunting or fishing expedition; and the point that claims our attention is that among those who are expected to participate in such undertakings there are commonly no defaulters. I have asked often enough what would happen to a hypothetical defaulter, but such questions seldom meet with a satisfactory answer because one's informants seem almost unable to visualize an unusual situation. It is answered simply that all the able-bodied who should take part will take part; nor can I recall any concrete case of a man deliberately shirking his duty in any major enterprise of the group. This willingness to co-operate or assist is a sufficiently striking native trait which we may call simply helpfulness. It is seen most strongly perhaps in war or in minor quarrels, where the native is always too ready to take up the cudgels in behalf of his people or his friend: it is the active aspect of clannishness. One of the reasons why a village is sometimes almost depleted of its young men because they all elect to ‘sign-on’ for labour in a batch is simply this desire to stand by one another. ‘What will happen to our brother’, they say, ‘when he is set upon by a mob of stalwart Kiwais, if we are not there to help him?’ But in all the incidents of daily life the same spirit of helpfulness is apparent: a man is lost, and there is a great turn-out to find him; if he is ill or in distress he is never neglected; if he cries ‘Help!’ there is an excited [Page 319] rushing to the scene. On the whole we may say that the Orokaiva seldom fails in this duty of helping the members of his group.' <sup id="cite_ref-1231" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1231">[1,231]</a></sup> 'Sometimes the whole clan will co-operate. This is seen especially when a move is made and work begun on a new area. Sometimes by invitation another village will come to assist in these initial operations. This is the nearest approach that the Orokaiva makes to the African working bee. Passing at noon through the village of Ohoraburari-so named because the ‘dance of the rooster’ was once performed there-we see the women already busy, and a great array of black pots on the fires. A little farther and we come to the new garden clearing, where we find at work the whole population, men and women, of a neighbouring village, Totoimaburari, ‘the dance of Totoima’, the legendary mankiller. Working with them are a few of the Ohoraburari people-such as are not more interested in helping prepare the feast for their paying guests.' <sup id="cite_ref-1232" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1232">[1,232]</a></sup> 'Clearing of bushland is often a community affair, with the lineage and sometimes the whole sub-clan co-operating, but planting is organised by individual households, with some reciprocal assistance from other households for specific tasks at irregular intervals.' <sup id="cite_ref-1233" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1233">[1,233]</a></sup> 'Kinship groups are of major importance in the functioning of village society in New Guinea. Every individual is a member not only of a parish but also of groups of closer kin, a clan, and maybe a lineage. Lacking any system of payment in cash for services rendered, the villager obtains the assistance of his relatives for heavy work such as the felling of big trees to make a swidden, dragging a canoe log to the beach, or making a long seine fishing net. Obligations thus incurred are met either by reciprocating when asked or by making a gift. The kinship group provides social stability and in practice the pattern of land use is frequently decided by the senior members of the group. The planting of food crops by any member, even on land to which he does not control cultivation rights, causes no concern because rights to temporary usage may be easily granted, but the planting of tree crops, which may remain in the ground from thirty to eighty years, is a different matter. Planting tree crops is tantamount to alienating the land for at least a generation and very often some members, at least, of the kinship group object to such long-term use. Even if they do agree to an individual member planting tree crops, there is almost always the assumption that he must share any profit he makes with other members of the group. Individuals who have planted cash crops under these conditions generally become discouraged when they see the fruits of their labours being reaped by kinsmen who contribute little or nothing towards production.' <sup id="cite_ref-1234" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1234">[1,234]</a></sup> 'Each clan controls some areas of mature rain forest, some of secondary forest, and some of grassland. Only the secondary forest is regarded as valuable garden land. The mature rain forest is potential garden land of the future, and grassland is unimportant, except for hunting. Clan land-holdings are fragmented within the confines of Yega territory. This pattern can be explained partly by the social system of land use and partly by the history of Yega expansion inland from the coast. The members of different lineages belonging to the same clan normally combine to clear areas of rain forest by communal labour. When the work is completed the land is divided among the lineages which helped clear it. This is the origin of the pattern of large continuous strips of land belonging to one clan, but sub-divided amongst the sub-clans and lineages of that clan as shown in Fig. 3. The commonly elongated shape of clan holdings is the result of continuous clearing in one direction by a group of kinsmen talking and joking as they worked and thus keeping close together. The small enclaves of land shown within the general Kurou clan area but belonging to other clans (Fig. 3) may be explained by affinal relationships. At various times the Kurou men cutting down the forest gave permission to some men of other clans, who had married Kurou women, to work with them. These affinal kinsmen thus acquired cultivation rights to small pieces of land, which have been inherited by their descendents. The first areas cleared were close to the coast; as population increased and more land was required, the inland forests were cut down in the manner described above.' <sup id="cite_ref-1235" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1235">[1,235]</a></sup> But this does not seem to constitute charity according to our own definition. We are unsure to which degree Orokaiva got involved in the charitable activities of missionaries.

<dd> <b>♠ voluntary community organizations ♣ absent ♥</b> Schwimmer mentions women's organisations, but it is unclear when precisely they emerged: 'The following brief description of women's organisations in the Sasembata area, and especially Sivepe, will illustrate the general propositions concerning mission-village relationships set out in the previous section. There are no traditional women's organisations among the Orokaiva, though the women do certainly at times act as a solidary group in village affairs, especially when a husband is seen maltreating his wife. The other women will then club together with the wronged [Page 126] wife, effectively shaming the husband. Today's organisations are sponsored by the government as well as the mission. The government employs a female “welfare officer,” attached to the Department of District Administration at Popondetta, who is charged with the organising and supervising of what are called women's clubs. These clubs, set up in villages, are expected to follow a set programme, designed by the welfare officer, aimed at improving village hygiene, housekeeping and craft work. The women are also encouraged to play basketball at club meetings. They learn to sew, bake scones, etc., make bark cloth for sale, are given talks on infant welfare and generally learn Australian ideas about home care. Clubs are encouraged to buy sewing machines, instructed in their use and care, shown how to cut patterns, how to launder, and so forth. Courses lasting two weeks are given periodically at the Higaturu Council building, to which a number of selected officers of local women's clubs are invited. Usually these are presidents and secretaries of clubs. They are taught the various skills to be inculcated and expected to pass on their knowledge in the village. The women are expected to persuade the men to build a meeting hall for the club. Money for the club is raised by regular dues, by the sale of bark cloth, and by the sale of cakes, scones and the like on club days. (The buying of ovens is also encouraged.) Inonda had such a club, built a club house in 1967 and had the use of a sewing machine. Kiorota had a club house, used not only by the women but also by the men when there were important visitors.' <sup id="cite_ref-1236" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1236">[1,236]</a></sup> 'In the Sasembata district, the women's clubs became fused with their mission counterpart, the mother's union. The latter had existed from the early 1950's, and were accustomed to have prayer meetings, clean the church and the cemetery, sew for the hospital and carry out other church work usually allotted to women. The president of the mother's union was the pastor's wife, a woman of some ambition. For the convenience of the members of the mother's union, many of whom lived too faraway to attend regularly at the mission station, several branches were formed, in places such as Kendata and Puri, while the villages within easy reach (Sasembata, Sivepe, Garombi, Binduta, Kongohambo, Torogota) mostly attended the central branch. When the government founded the women's clubs, the territorial units covered by the clubs soon became identical with the areas covered by the branches of the mother's union. Furthermore, the club which included Sivepe and the mission station chose as its president the pastor's wife, as well as the same secretary, a young Sivepe women. The two organisations thus became identical in territorial boundaries, largely identical in personnel and rather similar in some of their activities. To mention but one instance, it was natural for the club to use the mother's union sewing machine for the club sewing programme.' <sup id="cite_ref-1237" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1237">[1,237]</a></sup> 'The membership of the mother's union, in Sivepe at least, was somewhat larger than the membership of the women's club. The younger women were all active in both. Once a month they went to mother's union, did the necessary church work, cooked a common meal, prayed [Page 127] and sang hymns and gossiped. Once a week, or at least as many weeks as there was no obstacle to holding a meeting, they went to women's club, did some sewing, discussed club affairs and played basketball. The older women did not like the basketball and were not interested in the innovations that were talked about in the club. They only attended women's club on special occasions. There was a contribution of 2/- per month which was generally paid only by the younger women.' <sup id="cite_ref-1238" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1238">[1,238]</a></sup> We have assumed that women's clubs and other community associations emerged in the post-war period.

<dd> <b>♠ voluntary religious associations ♣ present ♥</b> Numerous new religious movements emerged during the colonial period. The Taro men feature prominently in the ethnography: 'Orokaiva shamans, or "taro men" serve as healers, weather magicians, and sorcerers.' <sup id="cite_ref-1239" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1239">[1,239]</a></sup> 'Dances are held often, sometimes accompanied by music, singing, and drums. From time to time, bigmen sponsor large redistributive feasts, featuring pig sacrifices and food distribution. Activities associated with the taro cult (the "Kava Keva" cult) are the major ritual activity. The Taro Cult began about 1915 and soon evolved into ritual practices meant to placate the spirits of the dea (SOVAI) who control the taro crop. Thus, it is both a fertility cult and a cult of the dead. Taro men lead the ritual which includes choral singing, drumming, feasting, and violent shaking movements.' <sup id="cite_ref-1240" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1240">[1,240]</a></sup> 'The actual distribution of the Taro cult is in the main confined to the Orokaiva tribes. Northwards it seems to have stopped short of the Waria people, who while possessing many affinities with the Orokaiva, speak a different language. It is firmly established along the lower Gira, but on the middle Gira it seems to have made small headway, partly because of a minor cult of Wo-embo, or ‘animal men’, a clique of hunting magicians, and partly because of the long-established mission station at Peo.' <sup id="cite_ref-1241" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1241">[1,241]</a></sup> 'Commencing from the mouth of the Mambare the movement seems to have spread at first in two principal directions-up the Mambare itself, and southward down the coast. Then it would seem to have penetrated inland from the coast by two principal routes-up the river Kumusi, and up the thickly populated road from Buna through Sangara to Kokoda. To the Aiga, who are a comparatively isolated tribe, the Taro cult has found its way by both these latter routes, from the east via the river Kumusi, and from the south via Wasida, a populous [Page 23] district on the Buna-Kokoda road. The movement has long since extended beyond the boundary of the Northern Division unto the North-eastern Division on the south. After ten years it is still spreading, though with a much reduced momentum. In March of 1925 it had first reached the village of Kawawoke in the Hydrographer's valley, inhabited by a mountain people who are very distinct from the Orokaiva. It has made considerable progress down the coast, and recent parties of propagandists had even reached the mission station at Wanigela in Colling-wood Bay. It is interesting to conjecture what may be the ultimate end of the Taro. It has so far made a more general appeal and displayed a greater tenacity than any other of the new religious cults of Papua.' <sup id="cite_ref-1242" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1242">[1,242]</a></sup> Williams describes a ceremony: 'A scene witnessed in the Aiga country is in many ways typical of the Taro cult, and in it we may see the medicine man at one of his characteristic tasks. A number of guests have assembled in the village of Totemaburari. The night and much of the forenoon have been spent in singing Taro songs, but still the revellers, whose endurance is greater than the jazzer's, show no signs of exhaustion. The principal Taro man, named Home, has been of late visited by his deceased father and has awoken to find a fresh supply of medicines in his hand. He now carries, strung together, a number of tiny packets, each neatly done up in a wrapping of green leaf, and each a very sizable mouthful. Upon close examination the packet proves to contain a somewhat repulsive hotchpotch, or rather salad, of five taro medicines, which have been already chewed with betel, spat out, and wrapped in the tidy, fair-seeming, little parcels to await a second chewing. At about noon Home, supported by two assistants who are like himself qualified Taro men, and attended by some twenty boisterous youths, sallies forth to perform the business of the day. This is nothing less than a wholesale medical treatment of the taro. Pushing rapidly through the garden, Home is seen to stoop and spray the medicines from his mouth over the taro leaves. He is continually tearing the husks from betel-nuts, which are necessary both to keep up his spirits and to ensure a suitably liquid medium for the ba sivo,   and continually plies himself with the little green packets which contain the ba sivo   itself. Here and there he pauses to break off some of the larger leaves (for the taros are well advanced and almost shoulder high). His two associates are similarly engaged, and meanwhile the chorus of young men, armed with their drums, are following or crowding around. The progress of the party is rapid and almost reckless: in reality the ceremony must conduce rather to the destruction than the growth of the taro, for the young drummers care little where they trample. The heat of the overhead sun is beyond endurance. The thirsty young men tear down bunches of sugar-cane and pounce upon the water-melons, regardless of their owners. One vociferous old woman stands in valiant defence of her melons, and a number of girls run on ahead to pluck their betel-pepper before the all-devouring chorus has reached it. But there is no lack of goodwill and merriment, and when, after almost two hours of this exceedingly strenuous employment, the Taro men return to the village, it is to partake of the feast which concludes almost every native ceremony.' <sup id="cite_ref-1243" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1243">[1,243]</a></sup>

Ordinances whose provisions had a particular relevance for Northern Division were those that imposed a tax and made cash cropping, carrying and roadbuilding compulsory.' <sup id="cite_ref-1244" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1244">[1,244]</a></sup> 'In spite of lobbying from Europeans, a tax on the indigenous population was not imposed until 1918 when a £2 head tax per annum on adult males was instituted (Griffin et al. 1979:23; Wolfers 1975:34, 37; PAR 1894:v, vii, viii).' <sup id="cite_ref-1245" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1245">[1,245]</a></sup> This necessitated the uptake of cash-cropping, but the colonial authorities also introduced a compulsory labour service: 'Cash cropping. The initial ordinance requiring villages to plant coconuts was passed in 1894, the intention being that the cash income would benefit the villages. Despite the fact that the planting of the communal stands was difficult to enforce and that the copra brought little cash return, by 1914 there were 10,000 planted palms in the Buna area. In 1918 the Native Plantation Ordinance set out more clearly new mechanisms of operation. In accordance with this, in 1921 the Crown started buying land for Native Plantations. Able-bodied men within 5 miles were required to work 60 days a year in lieu of tax. Failure to do so meant that they had to pay tax and, in addition, risk a fine or imprisonment. It was originally envisaged that the produce from the plantation would be divided between villagers and government but, in practice, the produce was sold and the money divided between the villagers and the government. The government's share was to be spent on works benefiting the Papuans. This part of the scheme was never fully implemented. Villagers' returns from the copra sales remained very small and occasionally they expressed their anger at this. Coffee planted under the scheme gave better returns and, by 1939, the areas planted with this cash crop around Higaturu were producing 84 tons of hulled coffee a year.' <sup id="cite_ref-1246" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1246">[1,246]</a></sup> 'By the 1930s many Koropata men had been to gaol for disobeying one or other of the Native Regulations. Tax had been introduced before World War I and the consequent need for money was a powerful impetus for the planting of village cash crops and continued signing on for plantation work. In this decade more Koropatans were recruited to work on Kokoda rubber plantations, thus coming into contact with other Papuans. More of the villagers were becoming familiar with Papuans from other areas. The mission was known only by rumour until 1928 when the Anglicans bought 5 acres at Baravaturu. During the 1930s the more mobile Koropatans became acquainted with a kind of white man whose activities and objectives seemed to differ from those they had previously encountered, the missionary more interested in their beliefs than their labour power (Files 407, Karius in 409, 411; Box 6549, G91).' <sup id="cite_ref-1247" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1247">[1,247]</a></sup> 'Cash cropping too was brought about by legislative force (see Chapter 2) but was reintroduced and extended under policies of official encouragement from the powerful. The early force, the socialization and the indirect compulsion stimulated by tax requirements and new subsistence needs led to a compulsion for Orokaivans to sell part of their produce. Certain items planted with sale in mind came to be seen therefore as saleable commodities.' <sup id="cite_ref-1248" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1248">[1,248]</a></sup> 'In sum then, the mechanisms of pre-war colonialism included a compulsory tax, compulsory cashcropping, compulsory carrying and roadwork. Rewards consisted of tobacco, steel tools and cash, among other things. Results for village production were periods of enforced absence of men and, presumably, an increased efficiency in men's labour due to steel axes. Women's work continued without labour-saving devices and often without the help of the men. Food and labour came to be seen in certain extra-village contexts as a unit of value immediately repayable by another unit of value, such as tobacco or money.' <sup id="cite_ref-1249" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1249">[1,249]</a></sup>   'The developments towards capitalism in a peripheral area are not a result of indigenous agricultural or industrial revolutions. Authorities, according to Amin, make deliberate attempts to monetize the economy, usually imposing taxes and the compulsory growing of export crops. As the people are forced to search for money they are forced to sell their labour as a commodity (1976:204-5). The historical section of this study has demonstrated the working out of these processes in the Northern (Oro) Province of Papua New Guinea, although labour and products are seen as commodities only in certain spheres.' <sup id="cite_ref-1250" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1250">[1,250]</a></sup> According to Crocombe, compulsory labour requirements and produce taxes were in place until the mid-century period: 'Every able-bodied man between the ages of 16 and 36 years who lived within five miles of a plantation (except those employed by government, missions or European plantations) was required, by regulations under the ordinance, to work 60 [Page 12] days per year on the plantation of his village. Those who worked 60 days or over were thereby exempted from head tax (then ten shillings per year). Those who did not were liable not only to head tax but also to a fine of £2 or imprisonment with hard labour for a period of three months.' <sup id="cite_ref-1251" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1251">[1,251]</a></sup> 'As noted on page 7, half the produce of the plantations was to belong to those who produced it and the other half to the government. But in practice in the Northern District, producers were required to deliver all produce to the government depots at Higaturu, Popondetta and Buna. The half of the [Page 15] proceeds to be retained by the from head tax and native plantations). Average annual government revenue from the plantations was £1,082 and from head tax £14,003. After costs of collection had been met the balance remaining in the Native Taxation Account was transferred to two funds which were entitled, somewhat inaccurately, the Native Education Fund and the Native Benefits Fund.' <sup id="cite_ref-1252" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1252">[1,252]</a></sup> 'Hulling, marketing and administrative costs incurred in running the plantations scheme were paid from the Native Education Fund. The same fund provided a coffee pulping machine for each of the plantations which was more than about two hours walk from Higaturu, the produce of the closer gardens being pulped at Higaturu Station. In fact no money was spent directly on native education in the Northern District, though some small subsidies were granted to mission schools. The Native Benefits Fund provided for the salary of a Government Anthropologist, medical services, bonuses to large families and other miscellaneous expenses. Only about a quarter of the money in the two funds was spent on education (all in the form of subsidies) and much was simply left to accumulate. When the war broke out there was an unspent balance of £26,199 in the Native Education Fund. The whole plantations scheme (including Native Education and Native Benefits) was administered by the Director of Native Taxation.' <sup id="cite_ref-1253" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1253">[1,253]</a></sup> 'Native Plantations (Papua) Ordinance 1952 provided that the villagers would own the whole of the produce of the plantation instead of half as formerly. This ordinance also did away with the earlier requirement that villagers work 60 days per year on the plantation, and cancelled the provision whereby persons who worked on plantations for two months were exempt from tax.' <sup id="cite_ref-1254" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1254">[1,254]</a></sup> We have adopted 1900 as a provisional date of transition, given how the individual forms of taxation were introduced at different times. We have only included taxes imposed on the native population.

<p><b>♠ Wages ♣ ♥</b> Note: Rural economies were dominated by subsistence horticulture: 'The household is the basic unit of production and consumption, with swidden horticulture as the subsistence base. The main crop is taro, which occupies about 90 percent of the cultivated land. A variety of other plants are grown as well, including bananas, sugarcane, edible PITPIT, and a few introduced cultigens such as pineapples, tomatoes, beans, and sweet potatoes. Although the Orokaiva traditionally tended coconut, sago, betel-nut, and a few other varieties of trees in gardens, villages, and in the bush, their arboriculture was rudimentary in comparison to their precise and detailed attention to tubers, especially taro. A good deal of plant and animal food is obtained by foraging, especially in the tropical rain forest that covers most of the Northern District. Foraged animal foods include grubs, frogs, snails, rats, and bush eggs. Foraged plant foods are valued during the dry season, when roots, leaves, and fern fronds make up part of a meal. Fish are an important resource, being used not only for consum ption but for trade. Hunting is less important; the usual quarry consists of small marsupials, birds, and pigs. Pigs, dogs, and fowl have been domesticated and each man has one or more small dogs that he uses for hunting but that are ultimately destined for the pot. Fowl are a useful source of meat, eggs, and feathers for decoration on headdresses, spears, etc. Domestic pigs are slowly disappearing from the villages, due to a government campaign to eliminate pig husbandry in an attempt to improve village hygiene.' <sup id="cite_ref-1255" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1255">[1,255]</a></sup> 'Cooperation among men is common during hunting and house-building. Cooperation of a total village is rare, but there are cooperative hunting and fishing expeditions. There is also a sharp sexual division of labor. Men hunt; prepare tools and equipment; make sago; plant all crops, both traditional (taro, yams, sweet potatoes) and introduced (rubber, coffee); maintain the yams and rubber; harvest rubber; and market coffee. Women cook, care for the sick, maintain the taro and sweet potatoes, harvest taro, and market root crops. Men and women both fish, build fences, collect firewood, maintain and harvest the coffee crop, and market rubber.' <sup id="cite_ref-1256" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1256">[1,256]</a></sup> 'In response to Australian pressure during the colonial period, rubber, coffee, and coconut palms for copra have been planted, providing the Orokaiva with a reliable and substantial cash income in recent years.' <sup id="cite_ref-1257" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1257">[1,257]</a></sup> Unskilled wage labour and cash cropping were introduced during the colonial period: 'As a result of early colonial force it was men who were to be that part of the social group compelled to wage labour or to grow cash crops. This fitted well with traditional organization in which men were absent through the political demands of warfare and feasting. However, it did extend the situation so that women were called upon to do more of those daily work tasks which had been seen as the role of men. Even if the reinforcing ideology of sexual complementarity had broken down, the new outside powers did nothing legally to temper the ultimate physical superiority of the males: there was no official repression of wife beating or construction of an alternative model of marriage in law. Hence there was nothing in the law of the new power to inhibit a man's reliance on his wife or sister for much of his subsistence. While men control household money there exists the potential for greater inequality between men and women. As money can be hidden in banks it has the potential to be stored and to accumulate for a longer period than traditional items and, more importantly, can then be exchanged for almost any other item, transactions made for profit being possible within the capitalist system. As the Melpa men say (Strathern 1979:544), ‘Money is too “strong a thing” to be left to women to manage’.' <sup id="cite_ref-1258" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1258">[1,258]</a></sup> The same is true for towns: 'The establishment of towns, unknown before the coming of Europeans, has forced an even more drastic adaptation than have the changes in rural areas. For a man to leave his village and go to work in the town means long separation from his family and from his kin, an experience unheard of in the past. Separation from his relatives means that he may be facing dangerous risks from the sorcery of foreigners in an unknown country. This is one reason why migrant workers tend to live in kin clusters in the towns. Unemployment, inadequate living quarters, low wages, the necessity for paying in cash for all goods and services, and the obligation to send cash gifts to relatives in the villages, all add to the town dwellers' difficulties.' <sup id="cite_ref-1259" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1259">[1,259]</a></sup> 'The small urban population lives for the most part in towns whose original location was determined either by access to a good harbour for early colonial planters or, in the interior, by the availability of level land sufficient for an airstrip. Despite the greatly diminished importance of plantations and the relocation of most of these airstrips out of the towns, those origins helped determine the existing urban layout. Port Moresby and Lae, on the Huon Gulf, are the largest cities.' <sup id="cite_ref-1260" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1260">[1,260]</a></sup> But most of the Orokaiva populaton remained rural during the colonial period. The below variables may thus not apply to the Orokaiva.
